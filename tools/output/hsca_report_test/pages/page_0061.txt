the Civil Rights
Division
of the Department
of Justice
and President
Kennedy
issued
a strongly
worded Executive
order against
discrimination
in employ
ment that established
a Committee on Equal Employment
Opportunity
headed
by Vice President
Johnson
Kennedy's
civil rights
program
however
increasingly
alienated
southerners
and conservatives
Violence erupted
soon after
Kennedy
took office In May 1961 the
Congress of Racial
Equality
staged a series of freedom
rides in Ala
bama in an effort to integrate
buses and terminals
One bus was burned
by a mob in Anniston

Sparked
by the vicious treatment
of the nonviolent
demonstrators
protests
continued
in Mississippi
The
Attorney
General
petitioned
the Interstate
Commerce Commission
and in September
1961 the ICC

Trouble
exploded
again
in 1962 when James
Meredith
a 29-year
old Black Air Force veteran
gained
admission
to the all-white
Uni
versity
of Mississippi
Meredith
had been refused
admission
despite
Federal
court orders
requiring
that he be enrolled
The Kennedy
ad
ministration
supported
an effort to force compliance
by the State
but
Governor
Ross Barnett
was equally
determined
to defy the orders
In his fourth
attempt
to enroll at the university
Meredith
arrived
in
Oxford
on September
30 escorted by 300 U.S
marshals
He was met
by a mob of 2,500 students
and segregationist
extremists
who howled
"Two-four-one-three
we hate
Kennedy.
The hecklers
attacked
the
marshals
with bricks and bottles
The marshals
responded
with tear
gas
A bloody night-long
riot that
left two dead and scores injured
quelled only after
Federal
troops
had been dispatched
by President
Kennedy
Meredith
registered
the next day and began classes with
the protection
of marshals
who remained
with him until his gradua
tion in August 1963
Urging
the need for legislation
in a February
28 1963 address to
Congress
on civil rights
President
Kennedy
attacked
the scourge of
racial discrimination
Race discrimination
hampers
our economic growth by pre
venting
the maximum
development
and
utilization
of our
manpower
It hampers
our world leadership
by contradicting
at home the message we preach
abroad
It mars the atmos
phere of a united
and classless society in which this Nation
rose to greatness
It
increases
the costs of public
welfare
crime delinquency
and disorder
Above all it is wrong There
fore let it be clear
in our own hearts and minds
that it is not
merely because of the economic waste of discrimination
that
we are committed
to achieving
true equality
of opportunity
The basic reason is because it is right
