ments retrieved
from the limousine
came from the same bullet as the
fragments
taken from President
Kennedy's
brain
(76)
Over the years
skepticism
has arisen as to whether
the rifle found
in the depository
by Boone is the same rifle that was delivered
to the
Warren
Commission
and is presently
stored in the National
Archives
The suspicion has been based to some extent on allegations
that police
officers who first discovered
the rifle identified
it as a 7.5 millimeter
German
Mauser
(77) The controversy
was intensified
by the allega
tion that
various
photographs
of the rifle
taken
at different
times
portray
inconsistencies
with respect to the proportions
of the various
component
part s.(78
To resolve the controversy
the committee
assembled
a wide range
of photographs
of the rifle
a police photograph
taken
where it was
found
in the depository
a motion picture
film taken by a television
station
showing
the
rifle
when
it
was
found
by
the
police
a
series of photographs
of a police officer carrying
the rifle from the
depository
photographs
taken
as the rifle was carried
through
the
halls of Dallas
Police Department
and photographs
taken later
by
the FBI
and Dallas Police Department
(79)
The examination
by committee photographic
consultants
determined
that all photographs
were of the same rifle
Both a study of propor
tions and a comparison
of identifying
marks indicated
that only one
rifle was involved

Summary
of the evidence
In the final analysis
the committee
based its finding that the shots
that struck President
Kennedy were fired from the Texas School Book
Depository
on the quantity
and quality
of the evidence
to wit
The findings of forensic pathologists
that the shots that hit the
President
came from behind
The results of the trajectory
analysis that traced the bullets to
the vicinity of sixth floor window of the depository
The conclusion
of acoustics experts
that
the shots came from
the vicinity
of the sixth floor window of the depository
The positive
identification
by firearms
experts
that
the rifle
found
on the sixth floor of the depository
was the one that fired
the bullet
found
on a stretcher
at Parkland
Hospital
and frag
ments retrieved
from the Presidential
limousine
The results of neutron
activation
analysis indicating
that it was
highly
likely that the bullet found on the stretcher
at Parkland
Hospital
was the one that
passed through
Governor
Connally's
wrist
and that
the fragments
found in the limousine
were from
the bullet that struck the President
in the head
The conclusion
of photographic
experts
that the rifle found in
the depository
was the same one that was repeatedly
photographed
in November
1963 and that
is presently
stored
at the National
Archives
The committee
also weighed
the firsthand
testimony
of witnesses
but
with
caution
because of the problem
of the passage
of time
Besides the statements
of law officers on the scene immediately
after
the assassination
it considered
the accounts of bystanders
in Dealey
Plaza
bearing
iii mind that
these were recollections
of fleeting mo
