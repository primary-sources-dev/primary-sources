where lie rented
a room at 422½ South
Main Street
and
moments
after
the assassination
he dropped
it near 424 South
Main Street
It is highly
probable
that James Earl Ray stalked Dr
King
for a period innnediately
preceding
the assassination
James Earl Ray fled the scene of the crime immediately
after
the assassination
James Earl
Ray's alibi for the time of the assassination
his
story of "Raoul
and other
allegedly
exculpatory
evidence are
not worthy of belief
James
Earl
Ray knowingly
intelligently
and voluntarily
pleaded guilty
to the first degree murder
of Dr
King
B
The committee
believes
on the basis of the circumstantial
evi
dence available
to it
that there is a likelihood
that James
Earl
Ray
assassinated
Dr
Martin
Luther
King as a result of a conspiracy
C The committee
believes
on the basis of the evidence available to
it
that no private
organizations
or individuals
other than those dis
cussed under section B were involved in the assassination
of Dr King
D No Federal
State
or local government
agency was involved in
the assassination
of Dr
King
E
The Department
of Justice and the Federal
Bureau of Investiga
tion performed
with varying degrees of competency and legality in the
fulfillment
of their duties
The Department
of Justice
failed to supervise adequately
the
Domestic Intelligence
Division of the Federal
Bureau
of Investi
gation
In addition
the Federal
Bureau
of Investigation
in the
Domestic
Intelligence
Division's
COINTELPRO
campaign
against Dr
King
grossly abused and exceeded its legal authority
and failed
to consider
the possibility
that
actions
threatening
bodily harm to Dr
King might be encouraged
by the program
The Department
of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion performed
a thorough
investigation
into the responsibility
of
James Earl Ray for the assassination
of Dr King
and conducted
a thorough
fugitive
investigation
but failed
to investigate
