the alinement
of the President
and the Governor
was consistent
with
the single bullet
theory
The panel also examined
still photographs
Several conclusions with respect to the validity
of the single-bullet
theory
were reached.(42)
The panel
concluded
there is clear photo
graphic
evidence
that
two
shots
spaced
approximately
6 seconds
apart
struck the occupants
of the limousine
By Zapruder
frame 207
when President
Kennedy
is seen going behind a sign that obstructed
Zapruder's
view he appears
to be reacting
to a severe external
stimu
lus This reaction
is first indicated
in the vicinity
of frame 200 of the
Zapruder
film
The President's
right
hand
freezes in the midst of a
waving
motion
followed
by
a rapid
leftward
movement
of
his
head (43) There is therefore
photographic
evidence of a shot strik
ing the President
by this time
Governor
Connally
shows no indication
of distress
before he dis
appears
behind
the sign at Zapruder
frame
207 but as he emerges
from behind the sign after frame 222 he seems to be reacting
to some
severe external
stimulus
(44) By frame 226 when all of the limousine
occupants
have
reappeared
in Zapruder's
field of view
the panel
found indications
in observable physical attitude
and changes of facial
expression
to indicate
that both the President
and the Governor
were
reacting
to their
wounds
The President's
reactions
are obvious—he
leans forward
and clutches his throat
The Governor
displays
a pro
nounced
rigid
posture
and change
in facial
expression.

To study the relative alinement
of the President
and Governor
Con
nally
within
the limousine
the photographic
panel
paid
particular
attention
to the Zapruder
frames
just before the President
and the
Governor
were
obstructed
by the
sign
employing
a stereoscopic
(depth)
analysis of frames 187 and 193 and still photographs
taken at
about the same time from the south side of Elm
Street
The panel
found
that
the alinement
of the President
and the Governor
during
this
period
was consistent
with
the single bullet
hypothesis
(46)
The
photographic
evidence
panel
determined
further
that
the
explosive
effect of the second shot to strike
President
Kennedy
the
fatal
head shot
is depicted
in Zapruder
frame

the President's
head is seen exploding
leading the panel to conclude
that the actual moment of impact was approximately
frame 312 (47)

of the President
Taking
the shot to the President's
head at frame 312 as the last of the four shots
and thus as a possible
