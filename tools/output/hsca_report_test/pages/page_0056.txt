The Cuban Revolutionary
Council
a group of anti-Castro
exiles that
was to have become the provisional
government
after
Castro's
over
throw
was particularly
bitter
about the Bay of Pigs
Its principal
leaders—Antonio
Macco
Justo
Carillo
Carlos
Heria
Antonio
de
Varona
Manuel Ray and Jose Mire Cardona—had
formed the Council
with the CIA's
sanction
and had been promised
recognition
by the
U.S
Government
They were outraged
by the failure
of the United
States
to support
the invasion
force
At a meeting
with
President
Kennedy
shortly
after the invasion
the angry leaders blamed his mili
tary
advisors
for the defeat
but Kennedy
replied
that he alone was
responsible
On the other hand
Kennedy
attempted
to reassure them
promising
that the United
States was committed
to returning
Cuban
refugees to their homeland
A stunning
setback
for the new administration
the Bay of Pigs
defeat
resulted
in worldwide
criticism
of the United
States
both for
its role in the invasion and for its reluctance
to back the refugees with
sufficient force to allow the expedition
to succeed It also gave Khrush
chev the occasion to lecture the new President
on international
moral
ity and raised questions about Kennedy
as a coolheaded leader
While
anti-Castro
Cuban exiles in the United
States believed they had been
betrayed
by Kennedy
and accused him of being a weak leader
who
was soft on communism
the administration
was criticized
from the
left as a reactionary
return to barbarism
Kennedy
traveled
to Europe
in June and met with Soviet Premier
Khrushchev
for 12 hours
in Vienna
Austria
Nuclear
testing
dis
armament
and
Berlin
were
discussed
but
the leaders
reached
no
agreement
Khrushchev
threatened
to end four-power
control of Berlin
by signing
a treaty
with East
Germany
that
would give it control
over access routes to West Berlin
In late June
he told the allies to
get out of the city by the end of the year
charging
that
the air
corridors
were being
used to import
spies and saboteurs
into East
Germany
On his return to the United
States
Kennedy said
I made it clear to Mr
Khrushchev
that
the security
of
Western
Europe
and therefore
our own security
are deeply
involved
in our presence and our access rights
to West Ber
lin
that those rights
are based on law and not on sufferance
and that
we are determined
to maintain
those rights
at any
risk and thus meet our obligation
to the people of West Berlin
and their right to choose their own future
Kennedy
responded
to Khrushchev's
threat
with a call for 217,000
more men in uniform
He ordered
the draft
doubled
tripled
if neces
sary
and requested
authority
to activate
Reserve and National
Guard
units
With
the Soviet
determination
to eliminate
West Berlin
and
the U.S
commitRnent to preserve it the prospect of a third
world war
was greater
than
ever
The crisis intensified
with the August
1961
construction
of a wall that prevented
eastern European
refugees from
entering
West Berlin
The United
States responded
by sending troops
and tanks
to West
Berlin
Western
rights
remained
intact
and the
crisis subsided
with Khrushchev's
decision in late 1961 not to sign a
treaty
with East Germany
U.S
armored
units in Berlin were pulled
back in January
1962
