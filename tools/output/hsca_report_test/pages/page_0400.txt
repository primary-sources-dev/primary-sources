John
Ray's
interest
in AIP
politics
also seemed out of character
since he apparently
had never evidenced
it before
1967 or 1968 and
since
as a convicted
felon
he was not able to vote
For this reason
and because of demonstrated
ties between both Sutherland
and Kauff
mann and the AIP
the committee's
investigation
was focused on this
connection
It was determined
that
a significant
amount
of AIP
campaign
ac
tivity occurred
in the neighborhood
of the Grapevine
Tavern
For ex
ample
Viola Anderson
who lived only oneblock
from the Grapevine
Tavern,(283)
was active in both the St
Louis Citizens Council
and
the American
Party
(284) In fact
her residence was a neighborhood
campaign
headquarters
in the south St Louis area and a likely place
for John Ray to have acquired his Wallace campaign
paraphernalia

The committee
also closely examined
Glen Shrum
since deceased
a
close friend
of Viola
Anderson
and
one who was instrumental
in
American
Party
organization
in the Third
Congressional
District
the
district
in which John Ray's tavern was located
Shrum was described
to the committee as an activist member of radical right-wing
organiza
tions
such as John
Birch Society and the Minutemen
Further
he re
portedly
attended
meetings of the National States Rights Party
and he
may have been in contact
with the Ku Klux Klan (286) His friends
also indicated
to the committee
that
he held strong opinions
on civil
rights
leading
him to be openly
critical
of Federal
legislation
and
court actions dealing with equality
for Blacks (287)
The committee
contacted
several American
Party
and White
Citi
zens Council members
who said that several informal
meetings were
held in the neighborhood
in which Ray's tavern was located during the
1968 campaign
Reportedly
Shrum
attended
many
of them (288)
In addition
Shrum
was apparently
at least an occasional patron
of
the Grapevine
Tavern
raising
the realistic
likelihood
of a contact
with John Ray (289)
Ultimately
however
the committee's
investigation
of the St Louis
conspiracy
proved
frustrating
Only circumstantial
evidence was de
veloped
Direct
evidence
that
would
connect
the conspiracy
in St
Louis to assassination
was not obtained
Several of the principals
and
possible
suspects
were
of course
no longer
living
and others
were
clearly
not inclined
to be truthful
with the committee
even when
faced with the possibility
of perjury
or contempt
prosecutions
Never
theless
in light of the several alternate
routes established
by the evi
dence through
which
information
of the offer could have
reached
James
Earl
Ray
the committee
concluded
it was likely that
he was
aware of the existence of the St Louis conspiracy.69
