sion said
however
that
a determination
of which shot hit the Gov
ernor was "not necessary
to any essential
findings.

V'uti°on
activation
analysis.—Tn
addition
to the conclusions
reached by the committee's
forensic pathology
panel
the single bullet
theory was substantiated
by the findings of a neutron
activation
anal
ysis performed
for the committee
(33)
The
bullet
alleged
to have
caused the injuries
to the Governor
and the President
was found on a
stretcher
at Parkland
Hospital
(34)
Numerous
critics
have alleged
that this bullet
labeled "pristine
because it appeared to have been only
slightly
damaged
could not have caused the injuries
to both the Gov
ernor
(particularly
his shattered
wrist)
and the President
Some have
even suggested
the possibility
that
the bullet
wounded
neither
Con
nally nor Kennedy
that it was planted
on the stretcher
(35) Neutron
activation
analysis
however
established
that
it was highly
likely
that
the injuries
to the Governor's
wrist
were caused by the bullet
found on the stretcher
in Parkland
Hospital
(36) Further
the com
mittee's
wound
ballistics
expert
concluded
that
the bullet
found
on
the
stretcher—Warren
Commission
exhibit
399 ((E
399)—is
of a
type that
could have caused the wounds
to President
Kennedy
and
Governor
Connally
without
showing
any
more
deformity
than
it
does (37)
In
determining
whether
the deformity
of CE 399 was consistent
with its having
passed through
both the President
and Governor
the
committee
considered
the fact that it is a relatively
long
stable
fully
jacketed
bullet
typical
of ammunition
often
used by the military
Such ammunition
tends to pass through
body tissue more easily than
soft nose hunting
bullets (38) Committee
consultants
with knowledge
in forensic pathology
and wound ballistics concluded that it would not
have been unusual
for such a fully
jacketed
bullet
to have passed
through
the President
and the Governor
and to have been only mini
mally deformed
(39)
The neutron
activation
analysis
furth'r
supported
the single bullet
theory by indicating
that there was evidence of only two bullets among
the fragments
recovered
from
the limousine
and its occupants
(40)
Ths
consultant
who conducted
the
analysis
concluded
that
it was
"highly
likely
that CE 399 and the fragments
removed from Governor
Connally's
wrist were from one bullet
that one of the two fragments
recovered
from the floor of the limousine
and the fragment
removed
from
the President's
brain
during
the autopsy
were from a second
bullet
(41) 3 Neutron
activation
analysis
showed
no evidence
of a
third
bullet
among those fragments
large enough to be tested
Photographic
evidence.—The
committee
also considered
photo
graphic
evidence in its analysis
of the shots
The Zapruder
film the
only continuous
chronological
visual record of the assassination
is the
best available
photographic
evidence of the number and timing of the
shots that struck the occupants of the Presidential
limousine
The committee's
panel of photographic
experts examined
specially
enhanced
and stabilized
versions
of the Zapruder
film for two pur
poses
(1) to try to draw conclusions
about the timing
of the shots
from visual reactions
of the victims
and
(2) to determine
whether
