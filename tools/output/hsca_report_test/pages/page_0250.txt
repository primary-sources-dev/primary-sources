It
has been stated
that
Oswald
claimed
to have served
in Tai
wan (183) The committee's
review of his military
records
including
unit diaries
that
were not previously
studied
by the Warren
Com
mission
indicated
however
that
he had not spent substantial
'line
if any
in Taiwan
These records show that
except for a 31/2month
period of service in the Philippines
Oswald served in Japan
from Sep
tember 12 1957 until November 2 1958 (184) Although
Department
of Defense records do indicate that MAG (Marine Air Group)
11 Os
wald's unit
was deployed
to Taiwan
on September
16 1958 and re
mained in that area until April
1959 an examination
of the MAG 11
unit diaries indicated
that Oswald was assigned at that time to a rear
echelon unit (185) The term rear echelon does not on its face preclude
service with the main unit in Taiwan
but the Department
of Defense
has specifically stated that "Oswald did not sail from Yokosuka
Japan
on September
16 1958 He remained
aboard
NAS Atsugi
as part
of
the MAG–11
rear echelon.
29(186)
Oswald's
records also reflect that on October 6 1958 he was trans
ferred within MAG 11 to a Headquarters
and Maintenance
Squadron
subunit
in Atsugi
Japan
(187) He reportedly
spent the next week in
the Atsugi
Station
Hospital
(188) On November 2 1958 Oswald left
Japan for duty in the United States (189)
Accordingly
based upon
a direct
examination
of Oswald's
unit
diaries
as well as his own military
records
it does not appear that he
had spent any time in Taiwan
This finding is contrary
to that of the
Warren
Commission
that Oswald arrived
with his unit in Taiwan
on
September
30
1958
and
remained
there
somewhat
less
than
a
week,(190)
but the Commission's
analysis apparently
was made with
out access to the unit diaries of MAG 11.39
Moreover
even if Oswald
in fact
did make the trip with his unit
to Taiwan
it is clear that
any such service there was not for a sub
stantial
time The unit arrived at Atsugi on September 30 1958 and by
November 2 1958 Oswald had left from Japan
to complete his tour
of duty in the United States (10)
Finally
with one exception
the circumstances
surrounding
Oswald's
rapid discharge
from the military
do not appear to have been unusual
Oswald was obligated
to serve on active duty until December 7 1959
but on August
17 he applied
for a hardship
discharge
to support
his
mother
About 2 weeks later the application
was approved
(193) 31
It appeared
that Oswald's hardship
discharge application
was proc
essed so expeditiously
because
it
was accompanied
by all of the
necessary documentation
In response to a committee inquiry
the De
partment
of Defense stated that "..
to a large extent
the time involved
in processing
hardship
discharge
applications
depended
on how well
the individual
member
had prepared
the documentation
needed for
