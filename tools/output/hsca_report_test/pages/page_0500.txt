agencies where information

the circumstances
if any
when an
investigative
agency
or a component
of that

should
be
disqualified
from taking an active role in an investigation

those agencies that primarily

The committee did not conduct a general inquiry into the operations
of the intelligence
or law enforcement
agencies Nevertheless
its exami
nation
of the performance
of the agencies with respect to the deaths
of President
Kennedy
and Dr
King afforded it a unique perspective
from which to view their operations
In effect the committee conducted
case studies of the FBI
and CIA
an experience that led the committee
to make a number of recommendations
The most important
single recommendation
the committee can make
in this regard
is that the proposals
for charter
legislation
be processed
for early consideration
by the House
Law enforcement
without
law
is a contradiction
in terms
Those who enforce our law must be able to
look with confidence to a basic charter
Otherwise
their power will not
be legitimate
they will not know their duties
and they will not know
their constraints
All too often the pressure of the moment will dictate
their actions
Just as important
there must be limitations
on those who
exercise power to protect those over whom the power is exercised
Free
dom is made possible by power limited by law There are a variety
of
reasons for the abuses of power uncovered
by the committee
partic
ularly
the harassment
of Dr
King
One may be clearly identified
and
must be remedied
It is the lack of basic charter
legislation
In a so
ciety that prides itself on the rule of law it is remarkable
that so im
portant
an area has been left lawless for so long
Charter
legislation
must go to the root of the role that
intel
ligence and law enforcement
agencies play in a free society
It should
clearly delineate the difference between the foreign and domestic roles
of the agencies
Society must not permit the morals of war to become
the routine
policy of domestic agencies
Citizens at home must not be
treated
as enemies abroad
Close attention
must also be paid to the relation
between intel
ligence
functions
and first amendment
rights
The first amendment
seeks to assure those out of power that they can still participate
in the
shaping
of policy
The cry for change must not be misunderstood
as a
call for violent revolution
Nowhere did the committee
find this con
