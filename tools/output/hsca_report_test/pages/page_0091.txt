61
Walker
shooting
was written
by Oswald.(138)
This
undated
note
although
it did not mention
General
Walker
clearly
indicated
that
Oswald
was about to attempt
an act during
the course of which he
might be killed or taken into custody (139) 15
The committee concluded that the evidence strongly
suggested
that
Oswald attempted
to murder
General Walker
and that he possessed a
capacity
for violence
Such evidence is supportive
of the committee's
conclusion that Oswald assassinated
President
Kennedy
(c) The motive
Finding
a possible motive for Oswald's
having
assassinated
Presi
dent Kennedy
was one of the most difficult issues that
the Warren
Commission
addressed
The Commission
stated
that
"many
factors
were undoubtedly
involved
in Oswald's
motivation
for the assassina
tion
and the Commission
does not believe that
it can ascribe to him
any one motive
or group
of motives.
(140) The Commission
noted
Oswald's
overriding
hostility
to his environment
his seeking a role in
history
as a great man
his commitment
to Marxism
and his capacity
to act decisively without
regard to the consequences when such action
would further
his aims of the moment (141)
The committee
agreed that each of the factors listed by the Warren
Commission
accurately
characterized
various
aspects
of
Oswald's
political
beliefs
that
those
beliefs
were a dominant
factor
in his
life and that in the absence of other more compelling
evidence
it con
cluded that they offered a reasonable
explanation
of his motive to kill
the President
It is the committee's
judgment
that
in the last 5 years of his life
Oswald was preoccupied
with political
ideology
The first clear mani
festation
of this preoccupation
was his defection
to the Soviet Union
in the fall of 1959 at the age of 20 (1.3)
This action
in and of itself
was an indication
of the depth of his political commitment
The words
that accompanied
the act went even further
Oswald stated to officials
at the American
Embassy
in Moscow that he wanted to renounce his
citizenship
and that he intended
to give the Russians any information
concerning
the
Marine
Corps
and
radar
operations
that
he pos
sessed (1.43) In letters written
to his brother
Robert
Oswald made it
clear that
in the event of war he would not hestitate
to fight on the
side of the Russians
against
his family or former
country
(144) The
paramount
importance
of his political
commitment
was indicated
in
one letter
in which he informed
his family
that he did not desire to
have any further
communications
with them as he was starting
a new
life in Russia
It was also reflected in his attempt
to commit suicide
when he was informed
he would not be allowed to remain in the Soviet
Union (145)
In
considering
which
were
the
dominant
forces
in
Oswald's life
the committee
therefore
relied on Oswald's
willingness
