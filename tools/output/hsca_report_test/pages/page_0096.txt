Dr
Kersta
did not indicate
in his letter that
he had found shots
and
the results of his tests were not mentioned
in the Warren
Report
The committee
was unable to locate the Kersta
spectographs
in the
National
Archives
until late 1978 (they had been misfiled)
but it did
obtain
the tape
recording
made on November
22
1963 by KBOX
reporter
Sam Pate
On May 11 1978 the committee
submitted
the
tape to an acoustical
consultant
for analysis
with these results:(4)
While a portion of the tape was recorded on November 22 1963
in the vicinity
of Dealey
Plaza
it was thought
not to be con
temporaneous
with the assassination
Other portions
of the tape
moreover
seemed to have been recorded
at least in large part
in a studio
since appropriate
background
noise was not present
And even if the tape had been made during
the firing of the
shots
and
had
recorded
them
Kersta's
spectographic
analysis
would not have found them
The committee's
consultant
advised
that
spectographic
analysis
is appropriate
only
for
detecting
tonal
or harmonic
sound
To identify
a gunshot
the analysis
must be able to portray
a waveform
on an oscilloscope or similar
such device

Dallas Police Department
recordings
To resolve questions
concerning
the number
timing
and origin of
the shots fired in Dealey
Plaza
the committee
asked its acoustical
consultant
to examine
recordings
not analyzed
acoustically
by the
Warren
Commission
specifically
Dallas
Police Department
dispatch
transmissions
for November 22 1963.1
These transmissions
received over the police radio network
from
officers in the field were recorded at Dallas police headquarters
Two
recording
systems were in use at the time—a Dictabelt
for channel 1
and a Gray Audograph
disc recording
for channel 2.2(5)
The committee
held 2 days of public hearings—on
September
11
1978 and December
29 1978—in which it attempted
to present
the
essential evidence from the acoustical analysis
Because of time limita
tions
it was not possible to present all of the evidence in the hearings

Analysis
by Bolt Beranek
and Newman.—In
order to identify
the nature
and origin
of sound
impulses
in a recording
acoustical
analysis
may include
among other means of examination
a delinea
tion and study of the shape of its electrical
waveforms
and a precise
measurement
and study of the timing
of impulses
on the recording
In May 1978 the committee
contracted
with Bolt Beranek
and New
man Inc
(BBN)
of Cambridge
Mass.
to perform
this sort of anal
ysis
The study
was supervised
by Dr
James
E
Barger
the firm's
chief scientist
Bolt
Beranek
and Newman
specializes
in acoustical
analysis
and
performs
such work as locating
submarines
by analyzing
underwater
sound impulses
It pioneered
the technique
of using sound recordings
