Rodriguez
said Lopez left Key West in late 1963 for Tampa
with
the hope of being able to return
to Cuba
explaining
he was afraid
he would be drafted
into the U.S
military
Rodriguez
said Lopez had
not been involved in pro-Castro
activity
in Key West
but that he was
definitely
pro-Castro
and he had
once gotten
into
a fistfight
over
his Castro sympathies
(140)
The FBI
had previously
documented
that Lopez had actually
been
in contact with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee
and had attended
a
meeting
in Tampa
on November
20 1963 In a March 1964 report
it
recounted
that at a November 17 meeting of the Tampa FPCC
Lopez
had said he had not been granted
permission
to return
to Cuba but
that he was awaiting
a phone call about his return
to his homeland
In that Marsh
report
a Tampa
FPCC
member was quoted as saying
she called a friend
in Cuba on December
8 1963 and was told that
Lopez had arrived
safely
She also said that
the Tampa
chapter
of
the FPCC
had given Lopez about $190 for the trip to Cuba and that
he had gone to Cuba by way of Mexico because he did not have a
passport
(141)
The March 1964 FBI report stated that Lopez did have a U.S
nass
port—it
had been issued in January
1960 and was numbered
310162
His
Mexican
tourist
card
was numbered
M8–24553 and was issued
November
20 1963 in Tampa
The report
also confirmed
that Lopez
entered Mexico via Laredo
Tex. by automobile
on November 23 and
he departed
for Havana
on November
27 the only passenger
on a
Cubana
flight
He was carrying
a Cuban
courtesy
visa.(143)
Lopez
FBI
file contained
a memorandum
from the Tampa
office
Dated October 26 1961 it read
It is felt that information
developed regarding
the subject
is not
sufficient
to
merit
consideration
for
the
Security
Index
(143)
The only information
transmitted
by the FBI
to the Warren
Com
mission
the committee
determined
concerned
a passport
check on
Lopez
Information
sent to the Commission
by the FBI
on the Tampa
chapter
of the FPCC
did not contain information
on Lopez
activities
The CIA apparently
did not provide
any information
to the Warren
Commission on Lopez (144) The committee concurred
with the Senate
select committee
that
this omission was egregious
since sources had
reported
within a few days of the assassination
that the circumstances
surrounding
Lopez
travel
to Cuba
seemed "suspicious.
Moreover
in March
1964 when the Warren
Commission's
investigation
was in
its most active stage
there were reports
circulating
that
Lopez had
been involved in the assassination
In its 1977 Task Force Report
the CIA responded to the charges of
the Senate committee
It claimed that the agency had carried
its in
vestigation
of Lopez as far as it could
having
questioned
a Cuban
defector
about him (145)
The committee
found
that
the absence of
access to additional
sources of information
was not an adequate expla
nation
for the agency's
failure
to consider
more seriously
the suspi
cions of its sources or to report
what information
it did have to the
Warren
Commission
Attempts
in the Task Force Report to denigrate
the information
that
was provided
on Lopez were not an adequate
substitute
for enabling
the Warren
Commission
itself to pursue
the
leads more aggressively
