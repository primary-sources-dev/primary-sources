were the assassin(s)

John

and Dr

Second
did the assassin(s)
have any aid or assist
ance either
before or after
the assassination
Third
did the agencies
and departments
of the U.S
Government
adequately
perform
their
duties and functions
in (a) collecting and sharing
information
prior
to the assassination
(b)
protecting
John
F
Kennedy
and Martin

and (c) conducting
investigations
into each assassi
nation
and coordinating
the results
of those investigations
Fourth
given the evidence the committee
uncovered
are the amendment
of
existing
legislation
or the enactment
of new legislation
appropriate
The necessity
for the committee
to explore each of these issues
as
well as the manner in which they could be investigated
was carefully
considered
by the committee because the committee was acutely aware
of the potential
risks and dangers inherent
in a congressional
commit
tee addressing
aspects of these issues The issues that posed particular
risks and dangers were the committee's
investigation
of who the assas
sins)
was or were and if the assassin(s)
had help before or after the
assassination
Necessarily
the committee's
inquiry
into these issues
would entail
an examination
of the conduct of individuals
Further
the conduct
to be examined
might
also be found to be criminal
in a
judicial
proceeding
and might well carry with it in the minds of the
general public
the severest moral disapprobation
because of the nature
of the crimes committed
Possible injury of the reputation
of potential
"subjects
or "targets
of the investigation
was therefore
a significant
danger or risk clearly recognized by the committee
The committee
also recognized
other risks and dangers
inherent
in
the special character
of its investigation
For example
associates of a
"target
might
have to be investigated
fully
The associate may not
have engaged in any activity connected with the assassination
but dis
closure of the facts of the investigation
alone might carry with it an
invasion
of privacy
of the associate
The risk and danger
were also
considered
by the committee
The committee recognized that
unlike a criminal
trial in a court
no
matter
how definitively
the committee's
findings were presented
in its
report
no legal sanctions
such as fine or imprisonment
could be im
posed as a direct result of its investigation
Nevertheless
the danger of
injury
to reputation
and invasion
of privacy
of the individuals
the
committee
had investigated
required
that
the committee
responsibly
assess precisely
how its investigation
would be conducted
and its re
sults disclosed
Many of the potential
risks and dangers from Congress undertaking
an investigation
into conduct that is also criminal
primarily
arise be
cause of the nature
and scope of a congressional
investigation
and the
procedures
a congressional
committee employs to conduct an investiga
tion The procedures that Congress uses are dramatically
different than
those employed
when individual
conduct
is examined
by either
the
executive
or judicial
branches
of Government
The manner
in which
the investigations
differ should be understood
by each person reading
this report
and should be considered by Congress in deciding when an
investigation
of this character
is appropriate
in the future
The primary
determinant
of the character
or scope of any govern
mental investigation
is dependent
upon which branch of Government
is responsible
for conducting
it Each of the three branches of govern
