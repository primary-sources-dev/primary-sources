Evidence
that
a curb in Dealey
Plaza
may have been struck
by a bullet during the assassination
Two shooter locations
were selected for the reconstruction:(22)
The sixth
floor southeast
corner
window of the Texas School
Book
Depository
since substantial
physical
evidence
and
wit
ness testimony
indicated
shots were fired from this location
and
The
area
behind
a picket
fence atop
the grassy
knoll
since
there
was considerable
witness testimony
suggesting
shots were
fired from there.
A Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle was fired from the depository
since it
was the type of weapon found on the sixth floor on November 22 1963
(23)
Both
a Mannlicher-Carcano
(chosen mainly
because it fires a
medium velocity supersonic
bullet)
and a pistol
which fires a subsonic
bullet
were fired from the grassy knoll
since there was no evidence in
August
1978 as to what type of weapon
if any
may have been fired
from there on November 22 1963.8(24) Microphones
to record the test
shots were placed
every
18 feet in 36 different
locations
along
the
motorcade
route where a motorcycle could have been transmitting
dur
ing the assassination
(25)
A recording
was made of the sounds received at each microphone
location
during
each test shot
making
a total
of 432 recordings
of
impulse sequences (36 microphone
locations times 12 shots)
or "acous
tical
fingerprints,
for
various
target-shooter-microphone
combina
tions
Each
recorded
acoustical
fingerprint
was then compared
with
each of the six impulse patterns
on the channel 1 dispatch
tape to see
if and how well the significant
points in each impulse pattern
matched
up The process required
a total of 2,592 comparisons
(432 recordings
of impulse
sequences times six impulse patterns)
an extensive
effort
that was not completed
until 4 days before Barger
was to testify
at a
committee public hearing on September
11 1978 (26)
The time of the arrival
of the impulses
or echoes in each sequence
of impulses was the characteristic
being compared
not the shape
am
plitude
or any other characteristic
of the impulses or sequence (27) If
a point
(representing
time of arrival
of an echo) in a sequence of the
1963 dispatch
tape could be correlated
within
±6/1,000
of a second to
apoint
in a sequence of the reconstruction
it was considered
a match
A ±6/1,000
of a second "window
was chosen because the exact loca
tion of the motorcycle
was not known
Since the microphones
were
placed
18 feet apart
in the 1978 reconstruction
no microphone
was
expected to be in the exact location of the motorcycle microphone
dur
ing the assassination
in 1963 Since the location was not apt to be ex
actly the same
and the time of arrival
of the echo is unique at each
spot
the ±6/1,000
of a second "window
would allow for the contin
gency that
the motorcycle
was near
but not exactly
at
one of the
microphone
locations
selected
for the reconstruction
(p9)
Those sequences of impulses that had a sufficiently high number of
points
that
matched
(a `"score
or correlation
coefficient of .6 or
higher)
were considered
significant
