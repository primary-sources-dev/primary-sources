170
with the underworld
of New Orleans that apparently
had escaped the
Commission
(268)
One
such
relationship
actually
extended
into
Oswald's
own family
through
his uncle
Charles
''Dutz
Murret
a
minor
underworld
gambling
figure (269)
The committee
discovered
that Murret
who served as a surrogate
father of sorts throughout
much
of Oswald's
life in New Orleans
was in the 1940's and 1950's and pos
sibly until his death in 1964 an associate of significant
organized
crime
figures affiliated with the Marcello organization
(270)
The committee established
that Oswald was familiar
with his uncle's
underworld
activities
and had discussed them with his wife
Marina
in
1963 (271)
Additionally
the
committee
found
that
Oswald's
mother
Marguerite
Oswald
was acquainted
with
several
men as
sociated
with
lieutenants
in the
Marcello
organization
One such
acquaintance
who was also an associate of Dutz Murret
reportedly
served as a personal
aide or driver
to Marcello
at one time (272) In
another instance
the committee found that an individual
connected to
Dutz Murret
the person who arranged
bail for Oswald following
his
arrest in August
1963 for a street disturbance
was an associate of two
of Marcello's
syndicate
deputies
(One of the two
Nofio Pecora
as
noted
also received a telephone
call from Ruby on October 30 1963
according
to the
committee's
computer
analysis
of Ruby's
phone
records.) (273)
During
the course of its investigation
the committee
developed
several
areas
of credible
evidence
and testimony
indicating
a pos
sible association
in New Orleans
and elsewhere between Lee Harvey
Oswald
and David
W
Ferrie
a private
investigator
and even
per
haps
a pilot
for Marcello
before
and during
1963 (274)
From
the
evidence available
to the committee
the nature
of the Oswald-Ferrie
association
remained
largely
a mystery
The committee
established
that Oswald and Ferrie
apparently
first came into contact with each
other during Oswald's participation
as a teenager in a Civil Air Patrol
unit for which Ferrie
served as an instructor
although
Ferrie
when
he was interviewed
by the FBI
after his detainment
as a suspect in
the assassination
(275) denied
any past association
with
Oswald
In interviews
following the assassination
Ferrie
stated that he may
have spoken in an offhand manner of the desirability
of having Pres
ident Kennedy
shot
but he denied wanting
such a deed actually to be
done (276)
Ferrie
also admitted
his association
with Marcello
and
stated that he had been in personal
contact with the syndicate
leader
in the fall of 1963 He noted that
on the morning
of the day of the
President's
death he was present with Marcello at a courthouse in New
Orleans
(277) In his executive session testimony
before the commit
tee Marcello
acknowledged
that
Ferrie
did work for his lawyer
G
Wray
Gill
on his case but Marcello
denied that
Ferrie
worked for
him or that their relationship
was close (278) Ferrie
died in 1967 of
a ruptured
blood vessel at the base of the brain
shortly
after he was
named
in the assassination
investigation
of New Orleans
District
Attorney
Jim Garrison
The committee
also confirmed
that
the address
544 Camp Street
that
Oswald
had printed
on some Fair
Play
for Cuba Committee
handouts
in New Orleans
was the address
of a small office building
