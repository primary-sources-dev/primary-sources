cycle police officers He told the special agent in charge of the White
House detail
that
he did not want
agents to ride on the rear of his
car
Kennedy
was philosophical
about danger
According
to Arthur
M
Schlesinger
"A Thousand
Days,
Kennedy believed assassination
was
a risk inherent in a democratic
society
In 1953 Schlesinger
recounted
then-Senator
Kennedy
read his favorite
poem to his new bride
Jac
queline Bouvier
Kennedy
It was "I have a Rendezvous
with Death,
by Alan Seeger.(15)
It may be he shall take my hand
And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath
But I've a rendezvous with Death
At midnight
in some flaming town
When Spring trips north again this year
And I to my pledged word am true
I shall not fail that rendezvous
During
the
November
1963 Texas
trip
he told
a special
White
House assistant
* * * if
anybody
really
wanted
to shoot
the
President
* * * it was not a very difficult job—all one had to do was
get on a high building
someday with a telescopic
rifle
and
there
was nothing
anybody
could do to defend against
such
an attempt
Kennedy
had decided to visit the South to bolster his image in that
region
He chose to visit Florida
because it had voted Republican
in
1960 and Texas because it only had been saved by Lyndon
Johnson
by an extremely
slim margin
According
to Texas Governor
John
B
Connally
Kennedy
first mentioned
a political
trip
to Texas
in the
summer of 1962 when Connally
a former
Secretary
of the Navy
was
running
for Governor
Kennedy
broached
the idea to Connally
again
the following
summer
Despite some obvious political
reasons for a Texas visit
some mem
bers of Kennedy's
staff opposed it because the State was not favorably
disposed to the President
From
1961 to 1962 the Secret Service had
received 34 threats
on the President's
life from Texas
Political
em
barrassment
seemed a certainty
The decision to travel to Dallas was
even more puzzling
Many
perceived
Dallas
as a violent
hysterical
center of right-wing
fanaticism
There
in 1960 then-Texas
Senator
Lyndon
B
Johnson
had
been heckled
and spat
upon
In
October
1963 just a month before the President's
scheduled visit
Ambassador
to the United
Nations Adlai Stevenson
was jeered
hit with a placard
and spat upon
Byron
Skelton
the National
Democratic
Committee
man from Texas
wrote Attorney
General Robert
Kennedy
about his
concern
for President
Kennedy's
safety
and urged
him to dissuade
his brother from going to Texas
There
are several
probable
explanations
for the decision
to visit
Dallas
Kennedy
was to visit four other cities—San
Antonio
Hous
ton
Austin
and Fort Worth—and
it was feared that ignoring
Dallas
would harm
his image in Texas
Kennedy
also was anxious
to win
