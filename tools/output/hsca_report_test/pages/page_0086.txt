In addition
the relative
lengths
of component
parts
of the alleged
assassination
rifle at the National
Archives
were compared
to com
ponent
parts of the rifle that
appeared
in various
1963 photographs
including
the backyard
photographs.(104)
They
were found
to be
entirely
consistent
component
part
for component
part
with each
other.12 Upon completion
of its analysis
the photographic
evidence
panel concluded that
the rifle depicted
in the backyard
photographs
is the one that was found in the book depository
after the assassination
and that was stored at the National
Archives
(105)
In addition
to the photographic
analysis
the committee
was able
to employ handwriting
analysis to aid in the determination
of whether
the photograph
was authentic
During
the course of the committee's
investigation
George
de Mohrenschildt
who had been a friend
of
Oswald
committed
suicide
The committee
pursuant
to a subpena
obtained
de Mohrenschildt's
personal
papers
which included
another
copy of the Oswald backyard
photograph
This copy
unlike any of
those previously
recovered
had an inscription
on the back
"To my
dear friend
George
from Lee.
It was dated April
1963 and signed
"Lee Harvey
Oswald.
(106)
In an unpublished
manuscript
de Mohrenschildt
referred
to this
copy of the photograph
and stated that
after his return
from Haiti
where he had been at the time of the assassination
he discovered the
photograph
among personal possessions that he had previously
stored
in a warehouse
(107)
The committee
examined
the photograph
to
determine
its authenticity
and examined the handwriting
to determine
if Oswald had actually written the inscription
and signed it If Oswald
did sign the photograph
his claim that he did not own the rifle and
that the photograph
was a fake could be discounted
The photographic
panel
found no evidence of fakery
in the back
yard
photographs
including
the one found
in de Mohrenschildt's
effects (108) The handwriting
on the back of the de Mohrenschildt
copy was determined
by the questioned documents panel to be identical
to all the other documents signed by Oswald
including
the fingerprint
cards (109)
Thus
after
submitting
the backyard
photographs
to the photo
graphic
and handwriting
panels
the committee
concluded that there
was no evidence of fakery in the photographs
and that the rifle in the
photographs
was identical
to the rifle found on the sixth floor of the
depository
on November
22 1963 Having
resolved these issues
the
committee
concluded
that
Lee Harvey
Oswald
owned the rifle from
which the shots that killed President
Kennedy
were fired
