Reverend
Abernathy
City
officials stubbornly
refused
to
confer
with
Black
leaders
and
steadfastly
rejected
proposals
for
desegregation
By September
1962 public parks
pools
and libraries
had been closed or sold to white business groups
The Albany
cam
paign received national
attention
but it failed to crack the southern
resistance
symbolized
by the city
From the Albany
defeat Dr
King
learned that the scattergun
approach
of simultaneously
attacking
all
as ects of segregation
was ineffective
On the other hand
the admission
of the first Black student
tc the
all-white
University
of Mississippi
in the fall of 1962 marked
a sig
nificant integrationist
victory
James Meredith
an Air Force veteran
had been enrolled at Jackson
State College when he decided to trans
fer to "Ole Miss.
With
the assistance
of the NAACP
he filed suit
when he was rejected
After
16 months of litigation
the Fifth
Circuit
Court of Appeals
ruled that he had been turned
down solely because
of his race and ordered that he be accepted
Outright
obstruction
by
State officials led the court to order that Mississippi's
Gov Ross Bar
nett and Lt
Gov Paul Johnson
pay fines unless they stop interfering
with its ruling
On October
1 1962 320 Federal
marshals
arrived
at
Oxford
to escort Meredith
to his dormitory
This action set off a riot
that
left 2 persons
killed
and 375 injured
before
it was quelled by
Federal troops
When the tear gas cleared
Meredith was the first Black
student
to enter "Ole Miss.
Despite
Governor
Barnett's
vow to con
tinue to fight his enrollment
Meredith
graduated
in August 1963
1963
A YEAROF TRIUMPHANDDESPAIR
Dr
King led an all-out attack
in the spring
of 1963 on racial dis
crimination
in Birmingham
Ala.
which he described
as "the most
segregated
city in the United
States.
Civil rights
activists
sought
removal of racial restrictions
in downtown
snack bars
restrooms
and
stores
as well as nondiscriminatory
hiring
practices
and the forma
tion of a biracial
committee
to negotiate
integration
Sit-ins
picket
lines and parades
were met by the police forces of Eugene
"Bull
Connor
commissioner
of public safety
with hundreds
of arrests
on
charges of demonstrating
without
a permit
loitering
and trespassing
On Good Friday
April 12,1963 Dr King
Reverend Abernathy
and
Rev
Fred
Shuttlesworth
were
arrested
for
leading
a demonstra
tion in defiance of an injunction
obtained
by Bull Connor
Dr
King
was placed in solitary
confinement and refused access to counsel Dur
ing his incarceration
he penned
his "Letter
from the Birmingham
Jail,
a response to a statement
by eight leading
local white clergy
men—Protestant
Catholic
and Jewish—who
had denounced him as an
outside agitator
and urged Blacks to withdraw
their support
for his
crusade
In this eloquent statement
Dr King set forth his philosophy
of nonviolence
and enumerated
the steps that preceded the Gandhian
civil disobedience in Birmingham
Specifically citing southern segrega
tion laws he wrote that any law that degraded
people was unjust and
must be resisted
Nonviolent
direct action
Dr King explained
sought
to foster
tension
and dramatize
an issue "so it can no longer
be
ignored.
