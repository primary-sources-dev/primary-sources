and second issues it identified—who
the assassin (s) of President
Ken
nedy and Dr King was (were)
and if there was a conspiracy
in either
case—so that
the committee
could effectively
perform
its oversight
responsibilities
in evaluating
the performance
of the executive
As
discussed
a resolution
of these issues was also necessary to determine
whether the amendment
of existing legislation
or the enactment
of new
legislation
was appropriate
Despite
the acknowledged
risks and dangers
to the reputation
or
privacy
of some individuals
the committee
believed that a complete
analysis and disclosure of all the issues it had identified was necessary
to fulfill its legislative
mandate
There was an equally important
rea
son the committee
believed
for public disclosure of the facts bearing
on these issues
The committee
had an obligation
pursuant
to its in
forming
function under the Constitution
to make public to the Amer
ican people the facts about each of these assassinations
and to respond
to public concern about the performance
of Government
agencies and
departments
The House of Representatives
recognized
that these two assassina
tions had been of extraordinary
concern to the American
people when
it debated and authorized
the creation
of this committee
The Ameri
can people clearly disbelieved the conclusions that had been the official
position
of the U.S
Government
Despite
the official position
of the
Government
that Lee Harvey
Oswald and James Earl Ray were lone
assassins
a Gallup
Poll
indicated
that
80 percent
of the American
people believed Lee Harvey
Oswald had help and 70 percent believed
James Earl
Ray had help
This public
disbelief in the conclusions of
the official governmental
investigations
was a substantial
factor
in
the creation
of the committee
(3)
The public
concern
however
was far more significant
than
mere
doubt about the official conclusions
of the investigations
Such doubt
extended
to far more serious allegations
concerning
the agencies and
departments
of the Government
These allegations
ranged from inten
tional coverup of known coconspirators
to actual governmental
com
plicity in the assassinations
Such allegations
called into question the
very integrity
of the governmental
structure
The committee
did not
believe it would suffice to respond to public concern simply by issuing
a finding on the question of agency and department
complicity
in the
assassination
No finding would receive public acceptance if support
ing facts were not presented
in 'fact it would most likely increase sus
picion of governmental
involvement
in the assassinations
if the finding
was simply that agencies and departments
were not involved
The com
mittee had a responsibility
to state who it believed had participated
in
each assassination
and what the factual basis was for that conclusion
To respond to public concern about the assassinations
and the per
formance of the executive agencies and departments
the committee be
lieved its informing
and legislative
functions
required an independent
determination
and public disclosure of the facts
Woodrow
Wilson wrote about the informing
function
of Congress
It is the proper
duty of a representative
body to look dili
gently
into every affair
of Government
and to talk
much
about what it sees It is meant to be the eyes and the voice
and to embody the wisdom and will of its constituents
