The President's
Commission on the Assassination
of President
Ken
nedy
(Warren
Commission)
concluded
that
President
Kennedy
was
struck by two bullets that were fired from above and behind him (1)
According
to the Commission
one bullet hit the President
near the
base of the back of the neck
slightly
to the right
of the spine
and
exited from the front of the neck The other entered the right rear of
the President's
head and exited from the right side of the head
caus
ing a large wound (2)
The Commission
based its findings
primarily
upon the testimony
of the doctors who had treated
the President
at Parkland
Memorial
Hospital
in Dallas and the doctors who performed
the autopsy
on the
President
at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda
Md (3)
In forming this conclusion
neither the members of the Warren
Com
mission
nor its staff nor the doctors who had performed
the autopsy
took advantage
of the X-rays
and photographs
of the President
that
were taken during
the course of the autopsy.(!)
The reason for the
failure of the Warren
Commission to examine these primary
materials
is that there was a commitment
to make public all evidence examined
by the Commission
(5) The Commission
was concerned that publica
tion of the autopsy
X-rays
and photographs
would be ,an invasion of
the privacy
of the Kennedy
family
(6) The Commission's
decision to
rely solely on the testimony
of the doctors precluded
the possibility
that the Commission
might
make use of a review of the autopsy
evi
dence by independent
medical experts
to determine
if they concurred
with the findings
of the doctors
at Parkland
and Bethesda
A determination
of the number
and
location
of the
President's
wounds
was critical
to resolving
the question
of whether
there
was
more
than
one assassin
The
secrecy
that
surrounded
the autopsy
proceedings
therefore
has led to considerable
skepticism
toward the
Commission's
findings
Concern
has been expressed
that
authorities
were less than candid
since the Navy doctor in charge of the autopsy
conducted
at Bethesda
Naval Hospital
destroyed
his notes
and the
Warren
Commission
decided
to forego
an opportunity
to view the
X-rays
and photographs
or to permit
anyone else to inspect them
The skepticism
has been reinforced
by a film taken of the Presiden
tial motorcade at the moment of the assassination
by an amateur movie
photographer
Abraham
Zapruder
In the Zapruder
film
the Presi
dent's head is apparently
thrown
backward
as the front right
side of
the skull appears to explode
suggesting
to critics of the Warren
Com
mission's findings that the President
was struck by a bullet that entered
the front of the head (7) Such a bullet
it has been argued
was fired
(41)
