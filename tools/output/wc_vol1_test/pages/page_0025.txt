Mrs. Oswald. Yes, he always helped.
Mr. Rankin. What about his reading habits there, were they the same?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes, about the same.
Mr. Rankin. Can you
tell us a
little more fully about his reading?
Did he
spend several hours each evening in this reading?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. Do you recall any of the books that he read at Elsbeth Street?
Mrs. Oswald. No.
He had two books, two thick books on the history of the
United States.
Mr. Rankin. Did your husband come home for a midday meal?
Mrs. Oswald. No.
Mr. Rankin. Did you go out in the evenings?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. Where did you go?
Mrs. Oswald. Sometimes we went
shopping
to
stores, and
movies, though
Lee really went to the movies himself.
He wanted to take me but
I did not
understand English.
Then on weekends we would go to a lake not far away
or to a park or to a cafe for some ice cream.
Mr. Rankin. When you went to the lake or the park did you take food with
you and have a picnic?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. How did you get to the lake or the park, by bus or car, or what
means of transportation?
Mrs. Oswald.
It was only 10 minutes away, 10 minutes walking time from us.
Mr. Rankin. Were either you or your husband taking any schooling at that
time?
Mrs. Oswald. Lee took English courses or typing courses.
Mr. Rankin. During what days of the week were these typing courses?
Mrs. Oswald.
It was three days a week.
I don't remember exactly what the
days were.
It seems to me
it was 1 day at the beginning of the week and 2
days at the end of the week that he took these night courses.
Mr. Rankin. Would
it help you
to recall
if
I suggested they were Monday,
Tuesday, and Thursday?
Mrs. Oswald.
It seems
to me
that
is
the way
it was.
I know
it was on
Monday.
Mr. Rankin. Do you recall what hours of the evening he was supposed to be
at these classes?
Mrs. Oswald.
It seems that it was from 7 until 9.
Mr. Rankin. About what time would he get home from work?
Mrs. Oswald. About 5 to 5 :30.
Mr. Rankin. Then would you eat your evening meal?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. How soon after that would he leave for the class?
Mrs. Oswald. When Lee took
his courses he
generally did not come home
for dinner, usually he didn't.
Mr. Rankin. Did he practice his typewriting at home at all?
Mrs. Oswald. At home, no.
But he had a book, a textbook on typing which
he would review when he was at home.
Mr. Rankin. How soon after the class was over did he come home ordinarily?
Mrs. Oswald. Nine o'clock.
Mr. Rankin. Did he
tell you anything about friends
that he met at these
classes?
Mrs. Oswald. No.
Mr. Rankin. While you were at Elsbeth Street do you recall seeing any guns
in your apartment?
Mrs. Oswald. No.
Mr. Rankin. Do you remember exhibiting any guns to the, De Mohrenschildt's
while you were at Elsbeth Street?
Mrs. Oswald. That was on Neely Street, perhaps you are confused, this was
on Neely Street.
Mr. Rankin. When
did you move
to Neely
Street from
the Elsbeth
Street
apartment?
