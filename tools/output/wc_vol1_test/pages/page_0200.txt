Mr. Doyle.
I know.
But start
it, and
if you get tired at
all, you advise the
Commission, and
I am certain that
Mrs. Oswald.
I will have something very important to this Commission that
I would like to say, that would take up some time.
Mr. Rankin,
I spoke with you,
I think
it was Thursday, December 6th, and I
told you that since
it was
publicly known
I was going
to appear before the
Warren Commission, that
I would like to have protection, as you recall.
I did
not get protection,
sir.
And so the next morning
I called you, approximately
9 o'clock,
in the morning and told you that I didn't have protection, and
I was
very concerned.
And
this would have been Friday,
the second
call, and that
I was going
to
the bank,
to my
safety
deposit
vault, and
get
the necessary
papers.
And I definitely wanted complete surveillance, because the papers were
going to be with me in my home, and the public knew
I was going to
testify,
and
I wanted that protection.
Now, you said you would get in touch with Mr.
Sorrels,
sir, and have Mr.
Sorrel's call me, which he did approximately an hour after my request to you
that
I did not have protection.
Mr. Sorrels called me and said "Mrs. Oswald,
I understand that you want to go
to the bank and get your important papers
out of the bank, and you have requested protection."
I said, "Yes.
I thought
I had protection last night.
I woke up 4 o'clock in
the morning with
all the
lights
lit,
getting papers together and cleaning the
house."
Because the telephone started to ring consistently.
I would have never done that if I would have known
I didn't have protection.
I was leaving myself wide open.
So he said, "Well, is your attorney in town ?"
I said, "No, he is not."
He
said, "May
I
suggest
this, Mrs. Oswald"—first, he
said, "What do you
intend to do with the papers?"
I said, "The papers will stay with me."
He said, "Is your attorney in there?"
I said, "No, sir, he is an out of town attorney."
He said, "May
I suggest
this.
May we get a large brown envelope and put
sealing wax on
it, and you put the papers in our safety deposit vault."
I said, "No,
sir, those papers do not leave my hands.
I have had an under-
standing with Mr.
J. Lee Rankin that the papers were going to stay with me,
and that I would have complete surveillance while the papers were in my home.
Now, Mr. Sorrels, I want that surveillance.
I am very uneasy."
He said, "Mrs. Oswald"—this was approximately 10 o'clock in the morning
"Mrs. Oswald, I will not be able to have anyone there before 1 o'clock."
I said, "That is just fine."
Mr. Mike Howard came out at 1 o'clock.
We did some errands.
I had to buy
some luggage, and a few
little things for the trip.
Then we had supper.
And
at 5 :30 we picked up the papers, because on Friday
in Fort Worth, Tex., the
bank opens from 4 to 6—on Friday evening.
So we picked up the papers before
6 o'clock.
Now, I thought
I had protection that night.
I had protection that night until
12
o'clock.
And then
I understand that the Fort Worth
police were
circling
the neighborhood.
Now, that is not complete protection.
I am a government witness, with important papers.
And Mr. Rankin had—
I
requested protection—suppose someone had come to the door, or just shot through
my home?
The
police
circling
three
or
four
blocks away
is
not
complete
protection.
So Saturday morning
I wanted
to go out to breakfast.
I kept opening
the
door and looking through the windows.
And
I never did see any men circling
the neighborhood.
There was nobody around.
At
10:30 this morning
I was
still doing that.
And by the way, a police car passed by and
I nailed him and
asked him
if he could check in the neighborhood for the Secret Service,
if they
were circling the neighborhood—because
I want to put my garbage out, and
I
needed to go out, didn't have breakfast.
He said he didn't know what the Secret
Service looked
like, and he offered to come to the back and put the garbage out
for me, which this Fort Worth policeman did.
