Mr. Rankin. She was getting away from that association, was she?
Mr. Martin. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. By going to the other city?
Mr. Martin. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. Do you recall any other conversation when she told you some-
thing that you don't believe?
Mr. Martin. Oh,
she remarked about people that she knew
in Russia that
had, we will say, lovers
Mr. Dulles. Did she
tell anything about a
letter that she wrote
to a boy
friend in Minsk?
Mr. Martin.
After she was here in New Orleans?
Mr. Dulles. Yes.
Mr. Martin. Yes.
Mr. Dulles. What did she say about that?
Mr. Martin. Let's
see,
she
said she wrote the
letter, and
I
believe what
it
was she told the boy that she wasn't—she wanted to come back to Russia,
to
him, she loved him, and the letter was returned,
I believe, for lack of postage,
and Oswald got hold of the
letter, and he asked her about
it, and
I think he
asked her either to read
it or he would read
it.
I believe she read
it to him.
This caused quite a bit of difficulty.
Now, that is when she was in New Orleans.
Mr. Rankin. When she was
telling you about these people that had lovers
in Russia, you didn't believe these stories?
Is that what you are saying?
Mr. Martin. Well, of course, I know nothing about Russian life.
Mr. Rankin. Yes.
Mr. Martin. So I more or less took
it with a grain of salt.
I didn't put any
credibility to it or any doubt to
it.
It was just something that was said and
I
didn't either accept it or reject it.
Mr. Rankin. How
did she happen
to
tell you about going to Minsk
to get
away from a married man in Leningrad?
Tell us how that came up.
Mr. Martin.
I think she was just talking about boy friends, I guess.
Mr. Rankin. Did she tell you she had quite a few boy friends?
Mr. Martin. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. Was that in Russia that she had the boy friends?
Mr. Martin. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. How many did she tell you about?
Mr. Martin. Oh,
boy.
Well,
she didn't mention any names as such, and
I
don't know whether different stories got confused to being two different people
or—I would say 10 or 12.
Mr. Rankin. Did she include Lee Oswald among those?
Mr. Martin. Well, you mean as a boy friend?
Mr. Rankin. Yes.
Mr. Martin. No.
Mr. Rankin. Did she
tell you anything about her relations with these boy
friends?
Mr. Martin. No.
Mr. Rankin. You say you didn't believe these stories?
Mr. Martin. Well,
I didn't have any reason to disbelieve or to believe them.
They were just conversation.
Mr. Rankin. Now, on the Nixon matter, when that came to your attention,
did you tell anyone else about it?
Mr. Martin.
I discussed
it with my wife, and with John Thome.
Mr. Dulles. Excuse me just a moment.
Mr. Martin,
this
is Congressman Boggs,
a member of the Commission, and
this is Mr. Leech, counsel for Mr. Martin.
Mr. Leech.
I know Mr. Boggs, I met him in New Orleans years ago.
Mr. Rankin. Will you
tell us about the conversation when you related this
to someone else?
Mr. Martin.
It was on the telephone, and
I was quite shocked at first about
it and then thinking it over, it didn't sound logical.
Mr. Rankin. You believed it at first?
Mr. Martin. Yes.
I guess I didn't see any reason for it not to be true.
