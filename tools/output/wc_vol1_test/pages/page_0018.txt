The Chairman. Now,
Mr. Thorne and
Mrs.
Oswald,
I want
to say
to you
that we want to see that Mrs. Oswald's rights are protected in every manner and
you are entitled
to converse with her at any time
that you
desire.
You are
entitled to give her any advice that you want, either openly or in private
; if you
feel that her
rights are not being protected you are entitled
to object to the
Commission and have a ruling upon
it, and at the conclusion of her testimony
if you have any
questions
that you would
like
to ask her
in
verification
of
what she has said you may feel free to ask them.
After her testimony has been completed, a copy will be furnished to you so
that
if there are any
errors, corrections or omissions you may
call
it to our
attention,
is that satisfactory to you?
Mr. Thorne. Very satisfactory, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman.
I might say also to her we propose to ask her questions for
about 1 hour, and then take a short recess for her refreshment, and then we will
convene again
until about 12 :30.
At 12 :30 we will recess until 2
o'clock, and
then we may take her to her hotel where she can see her baby and have a little
rest, and we will return at 2 o'clock, and we will take evidence until about 4 :30.
If at any time otherwise you should feel tired or feel that you need a
rest, you
may feel free to say so and we will take care of
it.
Mrs. Oswald. Thank you.
The Chairman. The questions will be asked of you by Mr.
J. Lee Rankin,
who is the general counsel of the Commission.
I think now we are ready to proceed, are we not, Mr. Rankin?

tell
you what I ask and you take your time about your answers.
