Mr. Rankin. So that you would have gone
to Dallas
to live with him some
time on or about the date that he rented that apartment?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. After you went to live with him in the apartment at Dallas, did
you separate from him again and go to live with somebody else?
Mrs. Oswald. Only after this quarrel.
Then
I stayed with my friends for
one week.
I had already told you about that.
Mr. Rankin. That
is the Meller matter?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. Do you recall that you
called Mrs. Meller and told her about
your husband beating you and she told you to get a cab and come to stay with her?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes, but he didn't beat me.
Mr. Rankin. And you didn't tell her that he had beat you, either?
Mrs. Oswald.
I don't think so.
Perhaps she understood
it that he had beaten
me, because it had happened.
Mr. Rankin. Can you give us any more exact account of where your husband
stayed in the period between October 10 and November 18, 1962?
Mrs. Oswald.
I don't remember his exact address.
This was a period when
I did not live with him.
I am asking about which period is
it.
I don't remember the dates.
Mr. Rankin. The period that he rented the apartment was November
3, so
that shortly after
that, as
I
understood your testimony, you were with him,
from November 3, or about November 3 on to the 18th.
Is that right?
Mrs. Oswald. From November 3 to November 18, 1962?
On Elsbeth
Street?
No, I was there longer.
Mr. Rankin. And do you recall the date that you went to Mrs. Hall's, then?
Mrs. Oswald. No, I don't remember.
The day when he rented the apartment
was a Sunday.
But where he lived before that, I don't know.
Mr.
Rankin. After you went
to
live with him
in
the
apartment, around
November 3, how long did you stay before you went to live with your friend?
Mrs.
Oswald. Approximately
a month and
a
half.
Perhaps
a
month.
I
am not sure.
Mr. Rankin. And when you were at Fort Worth, and he was living in Dallas,
did he call you from time to time on the telephone?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes, he called me and he wrote letters and sometimes he came
for a
visit.
Mr. Rankin. And during that time, did he tell you where he was staying?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes, he said that he had rented a room, but he did not
tell me
his address.
I want to help you, but I don't know.
Mr. Rankin. Did you think
there was something
in your husband's
life in
America, his friends and so forth, that caused him to be different here?
Mrs. Oswald. No, he had no friends who had any influence over him.
He
himself had changed by comparison to the way he was in Russia.
But what the
reason for that was, I don't know.
Am I giving sufficient answers to your questions?
Mr. Rankin. You are doing fine.
Did your consideration of a divorce from your husband have anything to do
with his ideas and political opinions?
Mrs. Oswald. No.
The only reasons were personal ones with
reference
to
our personal relationship, not political reasons.
Mr. Rankin. In your story you say that what was involved was some of his
crazy ideas and
political opinions.
Can you
tell us what you meant by that?
Mrs. Oswald. This was
after the
case,
after the matter
of the divorce.
I
knew that Lee had such political leanings.
Mr. Rankin. With regard
to your Russian
friends,
did you
find
the time
when they came less to see you and didn't show as much interest in you?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. Can you give us about the time, just approximately when you
noticed that difference?
Mrs. Oswald. Soon after arriving in Dallas.
Mostly
it was De Mohrenschildt
