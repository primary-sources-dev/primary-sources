The Chairman. Well, Mrs. Oswald, did you have a good trip here?
The Commission will come
to order, and at
this
time,
I
will make a short
statement for the purpose of the meeting.
A copy of this statement has been
given to counsel for Mrs. Oswald, but for the record,
I should like to read
it.
On November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order
No. 11130 appointing a Commission "to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the
facts relating to the assassination of the late President John
F. Kennedy, and
the subsequent violent death of the man charged with the assassination."
On December
13,
1963,
Congress
adopted
Joint
Resolution
S.J.
137
which
authorizes the Commission, or any member of the Commission or any agent or
agency designated by the Commission for such purpose to administer oaths and
affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.
Mr. Rankin. Mr. Chairman, excuse me, the interpreter
The Chairman.
I understood they have a copy and if they want to at the end
he may do that.
On January 21,
1964, the Commission adopted a resolution authorizing each
member of the Commission and its General Counsel, J. Lee Rankin, to administer
oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence concerning any
matter under investigation by the Commission.
The purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mrs. Marina Oswald,
the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald who, prior to his death, was charged with the
assassination of President Kennedy.
Since the Commission
is inquiring fully
into the background of Lee Harvey Oswald and those associated with him,
it is
the
intention of the Commission
to ask
Mrs. Marina Oswald
questions
con-
cerning Lee Harvey Oswald and any and
all matters relating to the assassina-
tion.
The Commission
also
intends
to
ask
Mrs.
Marina
Oswald
questions
relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent
death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Mrs. Marina Oswald has been furnished with a copy of this statement and a
copy of the rules adopted by the Commission for the taking of testimony or the
production
of evidence.
Mrs. Marina Oswald has also been furnished with a
copy of Executive Order No. 11130 and Congressional Resolution
S.J. Res. 137
which set forth the general scope of the Commission's inquiry and its authority
for the examining witnesses and the receiving of evidence.
