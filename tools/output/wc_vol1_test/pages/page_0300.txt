it does.

;
it does.
Mr. Jenner. Are you familiar with those signatures?
Mr.
Oswald. The two
signatures appear
on
the
second
page.
One
I am
familiar with—Mrs. Marina Oswald.
Mr. Jenner. Excuse me,
sir.
Is that the first of those that are in a series?
Mr. Oswald.
Yes, sir
; that is correct.
Mr. Jenner. And you are familiar with that, and that is her signature?
Mr. Oswald. Yes,
sir.
Mr. Jenner. The next signature purports to be that of whom?
Mr. Oswald. Mrs. Katherine Ford.
Mr. Jenner. And your testimony,
if
I repeated the questions that
I
did as
to the previous exhibit, regarding Mrs. Ford, would be the same?
You are not
familiar with her signature?
Mr. Oswald. That is correct.
Mr. Jenner. And the next signature, please?
Mr. Oswald.
Sir?
Mr. Jenner. The next signature?

Mr. Oswald. Two pages.
Mr. Jenner. Does
it bear a signature on the first page?

is a signature on
the
first
page.
The
signature
is Mr.

Mr. Oswald.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Jenner. The same gentleman we have identified?

sir.

Is that her signature?
Mr. Oswald. Yes,
sir.
I would say that was her signature.
Mr. Jenner. And the second name appears to be that of whom?
Mr. Oswald. Mrs. Katherine Ford.
Mr. Jenner. And your testimony with
respect
to
her, were
I
to pursue
it,
would
be
the same
as you
testified
to
a
previous
exhibit,
insofar
as
your
familiarity with her signature is concerned?
Mr. Oswald. That is correct.
Mr. Jenner. Thank you,
sir.
Forgive the interruption, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Dulles. That is all right.
Mr. Jenner. Mr. Chairman, Mr. MeKenzie has produced for us and tendered
to us four documents, during the recess, which I would wish to identify.
