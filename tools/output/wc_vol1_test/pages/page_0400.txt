Mr. McKenzie. And
I
call
the Commission's
attention
particularly
to
the
word stamped on the envelope "reeommende"
for whatever
it means.
Mr. Dulles. That is French.
Mr.
Jenner. Would
you
please
relate,
Mr.
Oswald,
Marina's
ability
to
speak
or
understand
English
at
the
time
that
she
and
your
brother
re-
turned from Russia in June of 1962?
Mr.
Oswald. Her
ability
to understand was
far
less
than
her
ability
to
speak English words.
I spoke
to her on the telephone the night
of June
13,
1962
from New
York
City,
to my
residence
in
Fort Worth,
Tex., and
her
statement
to me at that time was, "Hello, Robert."
I replied but no answer,
and Lee took the telephone over again.
Mr. Jenner. During
the month
they
lived
in your home, were you
better
able to form an opinion as
to her
ability
to speak and understand English?
Mr. Oswald.
I
believe
the
best way
to
establish
the
degree
of what
she
understood
in
English
at
that
time and
her
ability
to
speak
the
English
language would be very, very, very small, if anything at all.
Mr.
Jenner. As
to
her
facility
in
that
regard—did
her
facility
in
that
regard become better as the months and years wore on?
Mr. Oswald. Yes, sir.
Mr. Jenner. Was
there any
discussion which you
overheard
or
with
you,
respecting her undertaking to study, learn to speak, English?
Mr. Oswald. Yes, sir; she most certainly wanted to learn to speak English at
the time, and she was staying at my home in Fort Worth,
Tex., and prior to
their departure from Fort Worth, Tex., to Dallas, Tex., in the winter of 1962.
Mr. Jenner. What was your brother's attitude with respect to her desires in
that respect?
Mr. Oswald.
I do not recall him stating his desires in that respect either pro
or con.
Mr. Jenner. You have no impressions on the subject either way?
Mr.
Oswald. No,
sir.
I
might
have
an
impression,
pardon
me,
that
he
wanted her particularly at the time we were staying, they were staying at my
home in Fort Worth, Tex., to learn English.
Mr. Jenner. That was expressed in your presence during that period of time
by him?
Mr. Oswald. Not in so many words,
sir.
It was perhaps implied, and he left
me with the impression that he wanted her to learn English at that time or as
soon as she possibly could, and I might add that on a number of occasions during
the
visit at my home in Fort Worth, Tex., that my daughter Cathy, with her
childhood language in 1961, which would establish her age at 4 years old, would
talk to her and
it appeared that she would gather more English from Cathy than
she would the adults in the family.
Mr. Jenner. Did the State Department or any agency of the United
States,
get in touch with you with respect to your supplying funds or the possibility of
your supplying funds to your brother while he was still in Russia for the purpose
of financing his return to the United States?
Mr. Oswald. No, sir; they did not.
Mr. Jenner. Did any agency of the United States or any public body located
in New York City get in touch with you with respect
to supplying him funds
for his transportation from New York City to Fort Worth?
Mr. Oswald. Yes, sir, they did.
Mr. Jenner. Was that the
initial request or knowledge
to you that you
re-
ceived that funds were necessary, or would be needed for that purpose?
Mr. Oswald.
Yes,
sir, that is correct.
Mr. Jenner. Do you remember the name of the agency?
Was
it the one that
you identified yesterday?
Mr. Oswald. Yes,
sir,
it was.
Mr. Jenner.
All right.
In his letter of November 30, 1961, he makes a request for a football.
Did you send the football to him?
Mr. Oswald. No, sir,
I did not.
Mr. Jenner. In the
letter
of December
14,
1961, which
is Commission Ex-
384
