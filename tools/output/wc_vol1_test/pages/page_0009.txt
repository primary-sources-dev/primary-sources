Foreword
On November 29,
1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Executive Order
No. 11130, creating a Commission "to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the
facts relating to the assassination of the late President John F. Kennedy and
the subsequent violent death of the man charged with the assassination."
By
the same Executive order, the President appointed seven Commissioners
: Earl
Warren,
Chief Justice
of
the United
States;
Richard
B.
Russell, Democratic
Senator from Georgia
; John Sherman
Cooper, Republican Senator from Ken-
tucky
; Hale Boggs, Democratic Congressman from Louisiana and House Majority
Whip
;
Gerald
R.
Ford,
Republican
Congressman
from
Michigan
;
Allen W.
Dulles, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency
; and John J. McCloy,
former High Commissioner of Germany.
The President designated Chief Justice
Warren as the Commission's Chairman.
The findings of the Commission, based
on an examination of all the facts, are set forth in the separate volume entitled
"Report
of
the
President's
Commission
on
the
Assassination
of
President
Kennedy."
An essential part of the investigation conducted by this Commission has been
the securing of sworn testimony from witnesses possessing information relevant
to the inquiry.
This testimony has been taken under the authority
of Senate
Joint Resolution 137
(88th Cong., 1st sess.), enacted by Congress on December
13, 1963, which conferred upon the Commission the power
to administer oaths
and
affirmations,
examine
witnesses,
receive
evidence,
and
issue
subpenas.
Under the procedures adopted by the Commission, some witnesses have appeared
before members
of
the Commission,
others have been questioned under oath
on depositions by members of the
staff, and others have provided
affidavits
to
the Commission.
Beginning with
its
first
witness
on February
3,
1964,
the
Commission under
these procedures
took the testimony
of approximately 550
witnesses and received more than 3,100 exhibits into evidence.
The testimony and exhibits obtained by the Commission are printed in
this
and the succeeding volumes, organized in the following order
:
(1) Testimony before members of the Commission,
in the order in which
it was taken.
(2)
Testimony by sworn deposition or affidavit, grouped into four general
subject categories
;
the medical attention given
to the President and
the
Governor,
identification
of
the
assassin
of
President
Kennedy,
the background of Lee Harvey Oswald, and the killing of Lee Harvey
Oswald by Jack L. Ruby on November 24, 1963.
(3)
Exhibits
introduced
in
connection
with
the
testimony
before
the
Commission in numerical order.
(4)
Exhibits introduced in connection with sworn depositions and affidavits,
grouped alphabetically by name of witness.
(5)
Other exhibits introduced before the Commission in numerical order.
The transcripts of this testimony, prepared by qualified court
reporters, were
reviewed by members of the Commission
staff and,
in most instances, by the
witness concerned.
Editing of the transcript prior to printing in these volumes
was confined to correction of stenographic errors and punctuation, and minor
changes designed to improve the clarity and accuracy of the testimony.
In the
few cases indicated,
brief deletions have been made of material which might
be considered in poor taste and is clearly irrelevant to any facet of the Commis-
sion's investigation.
All the original transcripts prepared by the court reporters,
of course, have been preserved and will be available for inspection under the
same rules and regulations which will apply to all records of this Commission.
