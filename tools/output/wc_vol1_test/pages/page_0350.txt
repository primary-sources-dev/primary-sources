There are five dashes there.
And the word "shoot" was my intention to leave
blank there.
And the initials "NMR" stands for Richard M. Nixon in reverse.
Mr. Jenner.
I take
it,
then,
that
the
five dashes were inserted
there as a
substitute for the word "shoot"?
Mr. Oswald. That is correct, sir.
Mr. Jenner. And the initials are those of Richard M. Nixon reversed?
Mr. Oswald. That is correct, sir.
Mr. Jenner. Now, would you please
state
fully when
this matter
or
this
incident first came to your attention where and through and by whom?
Mr. Oswald. The
first time
I was aware of
this
incident was
at Mr. Jim
H. Martin's home in Dallas, Tex.
Mr. Jenner. On what day?
Mr. Oswald. On Sunday, January 13, 1964.
Mr. Jenner. What was the occasion for your being there?
Mr. Oswald. To visit with Marina, and to take her to the cemetery.
Mr. Jenner. You entered the home?
Mr. Oswald. Yes, sir.
Mr. Jenner. Was your wife, Mrs. Oswald, with you?
Mr. Oswald. Yes, sir
; she was.
Mr. Jenner. Your children?
Mr. Oswald. Yes, sir
; they were.
Mr. Jenner.
You entered the home, and who was there?
Mr. Oswald. Mr. and Mrs. James H. Martin,
I
believe their children were
also present, and in the living room of their home there was two Secret Service
agents, or one Secret Service agent, and two Dallas police officers.
Mr. Jenner. Are you able to identify any of those four men?
Do you recall any of them at the moment ?
Mr. Oswald.
I believe,
sir, that one of the Secret Service agents,
if he was
either the only one there, or two of them were there, the one that I do recall,
Mr. Bob Jameson or Jimson, of the Dallas
office—the U.S. Secret Service office
in Dallas.
Mr. Jenner. Now, to what Richard M. Nixon did the initials "NMR" as you
have placed them in this note refer?
Mr. Oswald. To the past Vice President of the United States.
Mr. Jenner. Now, proceed to tell us about how the circumstance arose, your
first conversation of it, your first notice of it.
Mr. Oswald.
I was talking with Mr. Jim Martin about various other matters.
Mr. Jenner. Excuse me, sir.
Where were you in talking to Mr. Jim Martin?
Mr. Oswald.
I was in the den of his home, sitting on a sofa.
Mr. Jenner. And who was present?
Mr. Oswald. Jim Martin and
I were sitting on the sofa, and
I
believe my
wife and his wife were at the end of the den in the kitchen part of it, standing
by the sink.
Mr. Jenner. What is the distance between yourselves sitting on the sofa and
the others?
Mr. Oswald.
I would say approximately 12 or 15 feet, sir.
Mr. Jenner. And was there a doorway, was it open?
Mr. Oswald. No, sir
; it is an open room.
Mr. Jenner. So you were all in the same room—one section of it you describe
as a den?
Mr. Oswald. Yes,
sir.
•
Mr. Jenner. And the other section consists of what?
Mr. Oswald. The kitchen, the sink, refrigerator, a washing machine, built-in
oven and range.
Mr. Jenner. All right.
Proceed.
Mr. Oswald. We discussed other matters.
I do not recall what they were.
Just talking to him about how Marina was doing and so forth, and any other
thing that we might be talking about in general, small talk.
And we finally
he finally brought up this question.
Mr. Jenner. What did he say and how did he approach it?
Reproduce it as
best you can, sir.
Mr. Oswald.
I believe he moved* very close to me.
I was turned towards him.
