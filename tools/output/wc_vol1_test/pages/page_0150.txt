Mrs. Oswald. June.
Mr. Rankin. Did you
talk
to Marina, and
did
she speak English
to you?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes,
she spoke English,
Mr.
Rankin.
Like
she would
say
and we used the dictionary when she didn't understand.
She would say— I would say, "Marina, you now nurse your baby."
"Yes, Mama.
The time."
Or "No time."
With motions—"no time, Mama."
She spoke English.
Mr. Rankin. What
I would
like
to find out for the Commission,
if we can,
in regard
to speaking
English,
did
you
think
she was
able
to
talk English
fluently, or did you think she was in the process of learning it?
Mrs.
Oswald. She was
in
the
process
of
learning.
But
she
understood
more than she could talk.
And
I have
a
letter from Lee
stating
that Marina
also speaks and
under-
stands
French,
that she had
learned
at grammar
school.
Mr. Rankin. Did you know French?
Mrs. Oswald. No, sir.
Mr. Rankin.
So you could not tell?
Mrs. Oswald.
I could not tell.
And I didn't think a thing of it.
And,
of course, Marina and Lee spoke Russian
all
the
time, even
in
front
of me.
And you
asked
about
this time—it was
a
very happy
time.
They would
sit at the
table.
They were playing a game, and
I
said
to Lee, "What
is
it
you are doing?"
Because they were always talking in Russian.
"Mother, we are playing
a game which
is
similar
to American
tic-tac-toe."
And
they
also
taught
each
other.
They had
books.
They
are both
chil-
dren—very
intelligent and
studious.
Lee was
teaching Marina
English, and
Marina was teaching him some things that he wanted
to know about Russia,
in my home.
Mr. Rankin. Now, you were saying that he got
this job at the Leslie Manu-
facturing Co.
Mrs. Oswald.
Yes,
sir.
And
then
his
first
pay—he
kept
his
first
pay.
And
then
the
second
pay.
he rented the home on Mercedes
Street, which
is the south
side, and approxi-
mately
10
blocks from where
I
lived
at
the Rotary Apartment, and approxi-
mately 10 blocks from where he was to work.
Lee had no
car, and Lee walked
to and back from work, which
helped
to
save money.
Now, you must understand that this couple had no money, and had nothing.
I gave them some
dishes, and some silverware, and
just
a few
little
things
that I could help out with.
But Lee did have the first week's pay.
And then the second week's pay.
And he rented this home which was $50.50
a month.
It was a nice little one-bedroom furnished duplex, in a nice neighbor-
hood, convenient to his work.
But then that leaves the boy broke.
I brought food into the house.
I never like to talk about the other members
of the
family,
because
to me
that
is
speculation.
But
I know
that
Robert
brought food,
also, in the house.
And they were not
in want.
Marina nursed
June.
Now, it has been stated in the paper that the Russian friends have gone into
the home and they are talking about this home, and found that they were in
desperate straits, that there was no food in the house, and no milk for the baity.
I say Marina nursed the baby.
They may have walked into this home, where maybe they didn't have at that
particular time any milk
in the box.
Maybe Lee was going
to bring groceries
home.
But
I know they were not
in destitute circumstances
in
that
respect.
They had no money and
didn't have anything.
1
brought
groceries, and
I
brought a roll of scotch toweling.
I had bought two packs and
I gave them one.
