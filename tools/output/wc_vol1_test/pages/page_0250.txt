And
I saw the brochure.
It was sponsored by very prominent people.
There
was nothing wrong with
it.
If he wanted to go, that was all right—could go on
this.
So he started to save his money to go.
However, this was in January
you want the date?
Mr. Rankin. Yes.
Mrs. Oswald. Are we in 1955 in New Orleans?
Yes.
No, 1956 this would be.
January, 1956—Lee took his money out of the Homestead, which was approxi-
mately $150, or something like that.
And Lee Harvey Oswald bought an electric
football machine—cost approximately $10.
He bought a bow and arrow
set
maybe about $6 or $7.
And he bought a gun.
Now,
I don't know about guns.
I was going to say BB gun, but
I
will not say
it was a BB gun—but Robert
Oswald will know—or a
rifle.
But
it was not an expensive gun.
He was just
16y2 years old.
And I am of the opinion if he bought a real gun,
I would have
had to sign or something.
I may be wrong.
But anyhow
it was a gun
to go
squirrel
hunting
or
rabbit
hunting.
I
will
identify
it
like
that.
And
then
we can go into it further.
And he paid $35 on a
coat for me.
And
the very
first
job
that—the very
first pay that Lee got from this job from Tujague sir, he came home with a bird
cage on a stand that had a planter.
It had the ivy in the planter,
it had the
parakeet, and
it had a complete
set of food for
the parakeet.
His very
first
pay.
And then he paid his room and board.
I kept this bird cage—the stand
was collapsible—all these years, in the back of my car, and put it up, no matter
where I was on a case, and had the bird up until about 2 years ago—no,
I had
the bird, and gave it to Lee when they came back from Russia.
What has become
of
it I do not know.
I gave the bird and bird cage to Lee and Marina when
they came back from Russia.
I am trying to give you the picture of this boy.
Would you ask me some more questions, please?
It
is awful hard for me to
remember everything.
Mr. Rankin. Do you remember any other guns he had?
Mrs. Oswald. No,
sir.
This
is the only gun that
I have known Lee to have.
Mr. Rankin. Now, about Officer Tippit.
Mrs. Oswald. Let me
finish about Robert and
his gun.
This
is important
to you.
When we came to New Orleans,
I worked at Washer Bros., in New Orleans
transferred from—Goldrings
in New Orleans
is Washer Bros, in Fort Worth,
Tex.
So
I worked
at Washer
Bros.
Lee came
into
the place
I worked one
day with the gun and wanted me
to
sign a paper so he could
sell
the gun.
Well,
I was indignant that he came where
I was working with a gun.
I said,
"Lee, we will talk about
it later."
And several of the salesladies thought that
I
brushed him
off
real
fast.
Well, now, Robert bought
that gun from
Lee,
and gave Lee $10 for the gun.
It was 3 months we were living in New Orleans.
So Robert gave Lee $10 for the gun.
And Robert used
to go hunting with
it
at his mother-in-law's house.
I have stated they
live in the country and they
go rabbit and
squirrel
hunting.
Robert would know about the gun,
the type
gun and everything.
I do not know.
Mr. Rankin. You have told us all you know about the gun?
Mrs. Oswald. That is all
I know about the gun.
And Robert bought the gun
from Lee, gave him $10.
Mr. Rankin. You haven't told us whether you thought your son killed Officer
Tippit.
Mrs. Oswald.
I strictly do not believe that Lee killed Officer Tippit.
Mr. Rankin. Can you tell us why?
Mrs. Oswald.
Yes.
I am
sorry
to have
to
elaborate
so,
but
this,
as you
know, is very important.
Mr. Lane and myself are
investigating,
with hundreds
of
investigators.
I
have over 1,500
letters.
We have reporters and
people investigating
for
us,
that are not satisfied with the whole case.
And Mr. Lane has a lot of affidavits.
I cannot say what Mr. Lane has.
But he
is doing a very good job about this.
And we have come to the conclusion that Lee is not guilty of Officer Tippit.
Now,
I gave you a picture yesterday—you might have
it there,
I don't know,
Mr.
Rankin—that could
possibly
be Marina and
the
child.
