It
is simply that
it
is pity to—I feel sorry for another human
life.
Because
this will not return—bring back to life Kennedy or the others who were killed.
But they have
their laws, and,
of course,
I do not have the right
to change
them.
That is only my opinion, and perhaps they will pay some attention to
it.
That is all.
Mr. Rankin. Had you ever been in the Carousel Nightclub?
Mrs. Oswald.
I have never been in nightclubs.
Mr.
Rankin. Did
you
know
where
it was
located
before
your
husband
was killed by Jack Ruby ?
Mrs. Oswald. No, I don't know it now either.
Mr. Rankin. Can you
tell
us whether your husband was
right handed
or
left handed?
Mrs. Oswald. No, he was right handed.
His brother writes with his
left hand and so does—his brother and mother
both write with their left hand.
And since I mentioned Jack Ruby, the mother and Robert want Ruby to be
subjected to a death penalty.
And in that we differ.
Mr. Rankin. Have
they
told you
the reason why
they wanted
the death
penalty imposed?
Mrs. Oswald. In their view, a killing has to be repaid by a killing.
In my opinion, it is not so.
Mr. Rankin.
Is there anything more about
the
assassination
of President
Kennedy that you know that you have not told the Commission?
Mrs. Oswald. No, I don't know anything.
Mr. Rankin.
Is there anything that your husband ever told you about pro-
posing to assassinate President Kennedy that you haven't told the Commission?
Mrs. Oswald. No, I don't know that.
Mr. Rankin. Now,
Mrs.
Oswald, we
will
turn
to some
period
in
Russia,
and ask you about that for a little while.
Can you tell us the time and place of your birth?
Mrs.
Oswald.
I
was
born
on
July
17,
1941,
in
Severo
Dvinsk,
in
the
Arkhangelskaya Region.
Mr. Rankin. Who were your parents?
Mrs. Oswald. Names?
Mr. Rankin. Yes, please.
Mrs. Oswald. My mother was
Clogia Vasilyevna
Proosakova.
She was a
laboratory assistant.
Mr. Rankin. And your father?
Mrs.
Oswald. And
I
had
a
stepfather.
I
had
no
father.
I
never knew
him..
Mr. Rankin. Who did you live with as a child?
Mrs. Oswald. With my
stepfather,
with my
mother,
and
sometimes
with
my grandmother—grandmother on my mother's side.
Mr. Rankin. Did you
live with your grandparents
before you went back
to live with your mother and your stepfather?
Mrs.
Oswald. Yes,
I
lived
with my
grandmother
until
I
was
approxi-
mately five years old.
Mr.
Rankin. And
then
you moved
to
live
with
your
mother
and
your
stepfather, did you?
Mrs. Oswald.
Yes.
Mr. Rankin. And was that in Leningrad?
Mrs. Oswald. After
the war, we
lived
in Moldavia
for some
time.
After
the war
it was
easier
to
live
there,
better
to
live
there.
And
then
we
returned
to
Leningrad
where we
lived
with my
stepfather's
mother—also
with my half brother and half sister.
Mr. Rankin. What was your stepfather's business?
Mrs.
Oswald. He was
an
electrician
in
a
power
station
in
Leningrad.
Mr. Rankin. Did you have brothers and sisters?
Mrs. Oswald. Yes.
Mr. Rankin. How many?
Mrs. Oswald. One brother, one
sister—from my mother's second marriage.
Mr. Rankin. How old were they?
84
