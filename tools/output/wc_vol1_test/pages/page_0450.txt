up
is that
I do
feel that Mr. Robert Oswald
is under
strict—the
strictest of
oaths to give his testimony only to the Commission, in the interests of finding out
the truth, and that he has not given any statements to the press nor have
I.
Mr. Dulles. On that latter point,
I would say that
I appreciate and respect
the position that you have taken in this
respect, that in the case of previous
witnesses,
the Commission
itself has no authority
to, as
I understand
it, and
has not attempted to "muzzle" witnesses that have appeared before it as to what
they themselves may say after the hearings.
The Chief Justice has enjoined them during the hearings not to discuss the
proceedings.
Am
I correct, Mr. Jenner?
Mr. Jenner. That
is my understanding.
Mr. McKenzie. And that is exactly the position we are taking,
sir.
And that
is exactly the position that we have taken, and will continue to take at all times
while he
is imder oath to the Commission, and until such time as he is released
from that oath.
Mr. Dulles.
Well, I will see that your statement is brought specifically to the
attention of the Chief Justice and Mr. Rankin.
Mr. McKenzie. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Dulles.
Shall we proceed, Mr. Jenner?
Mr. Jenner.
Yes, thank you, sir.
When the discussion of the Times article arose, you were in the process, Mr.
Oswald, of relating to us an incident of one evening in the home of your brother,
in which—with respect
to which Paul Gregory, the son of Peter Gregory, was
expected
to arrive at your brother's home and then
to drive about the city of
Fort Worth with Marina, she talking
to him
in Russian and he likewise
in
Russian, as part of a course of instruction
in conversational Russian between
Marina and Paul Gregory, who was
seeking to improve
his command of the
Russian language.
And you had reached the point at which you related a con-
versation with you in the presence of Marina, which you thought she understood
and she took sufficient part in to lead you to believe she did understand
it.
Mr. Oswald. That is correct.
Mr. Jenner. Does that refresh your recollection as to where we were?
Mr. Oswald. Yes, sir
;
it does.
Mr. Dulles. And
I would like to add, as
I understand
it,
it was indicated to
you by your brother that this was to be on a financial basis—that is, she was in
effect giving Russian lessons to Paul Gregory, and would be paid for
it.
Mr. Oswald. That is correct.
Mr. Jenner. Was any amount of money mentioned?
It was by the hour,
I
think you said.
Mr. Oswald. Yes, sir
; a figure was mentioned.
However,
I do not recall the
exact figure.
I could perhaps to the best of my ability and remembrance of the
occasion place the figure at over $3 an hour.
I do not
recall any further conversation that
I had with Marina and Lee
Oswald on that occasion.
I did leave their residence before the reported time that Mr. Gregory was due
to arrive.
Mr. Jenner. Did anything occur that evening, in the course of that interchange
and conversation, that had a bearing upon, or led you
to believe or have the
impression, that your brother Lee was seeking to break off or lessen relations on
his part and Marina's part with their Russian friends?
Mr. Oswald. No, sir
; there was not.
Mr. Jenner.
All right, proceed.
Mr. Dulles. Could
I ask one question there?
Did your brother indicate whether these lessons were being given in his and
Marina's home, or whether they were to be given at the Gregory home?
Mr. Oswald. No,
sir.
It was implied
if not stated to me at that time that
the lesson was to be given going around Fort Worth, Tex.
Mr. Jenner. This particular occasion?
Mr. Oswald. Yes,
sir.
Mr. Jenner. Did you get any impression, Mr. Oswald, as to the course of pro-
cedure in that respect for any future occasions, or those that had occurred in
434
