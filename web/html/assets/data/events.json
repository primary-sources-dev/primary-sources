    "context": "The Ralph Yates incident represents one of the most compelling witness accounts of a possible Oswald sighting before the JFK assassination. Yates, a refrigeration mechanic, reported picking up a hitchhiker matching Oswald's description who carried a package and discussed shooting the President from a window. The FBI conducted extensive interviews but ultimately determined discrepancies in Yates' timeline. Yates later experienced a mental health crisis and was hospitalized. The case remains disputed among researchers.",
