YATES atated the man then asked YATES if he thought 
a 
person could assassinate the President. 
YATES replied that he 
guessed such a thing could be possible. 
The man then asked YATES 
if it could be done from the. top of 
a building or out of a window, 
high up, 
and YATES said he guessed this was possible if one had 
a good rifle with a scope and was a good abot. 
YATES advised about this time the man pulled out 
a 
picture which sitved 
a man with a rifle and asked YATES if he thought 
the President could be killed with 
a gun like that one. 
YATES 
said he was driving and did not look at the picture but indicated 
to the man that he guessed so, 
YATES said that the man then asked if he knew the 
President's route for the parade in Dallas and YATES replied that 
he did not know the route but that 
it had been in the paper. 
He 
said the man then said that he had misunderstood him and that 
actually he had asked YATES if he thought that the President would 
change his route, 
YATES said he replied that 
he doubted 
it unless 
they might for safety reasons. 
' 
He said as they approached 
downtown Dallas, 
the man 
indicated that he was going on Houston Street and that although he 
was going to Irving, 
he told the man he would drive off the 
expressway and to Houston Street and let him out there, then would 
go back to the expressway. 
YATES said he went off the Expressway 
on Commerce Street, 
turned off of Commerce on Houston, 
drove north 
on Houston and let the man off on the corner of Elm and Houston 
Streets. 
He said he saw the man cross Elm Street, 
but does not 
know where he went from there. 
He said that as the man got out 
of the truck, 
he recalled him saying something about the Triple 
Underpass, but cannot recall exactly what was said.

Mr. GILPIN, had ordered or called 
YATES to go to Irving, Texas, on a service call to the 
Park-It Market Drive-In Grocery, 
at 2320 Shady Grove Road

"Dallas, 
Texas, 
January 4, 1964 
"I, RALPH LEON YATES, make the following statement 
voluntarily to WARREN C. DE BRUEYS and C. RAY HALL, 
who have 
identified themselves 
to me as Special Agents of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. 
No threats or promises have been 
made 
to me to get me 
to make this statement. 
I have been told 
that 
I do not have to make a statement, and that 
I have a right 
to talk with a lawyer before making any statement. 
I have been 
told that any statement 
I make can be used against me in a 
court of law. 
On December 10, 1963 
1 furnished a signed statement 
to 
CG, RAY HALL and MAURICE J. WHITE, Special Agmts of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
and on this day 
I have re-read 
this statement and SA DE BRUEYS has read it to me and I now 
wish to make the following changes. 
In my statement of December 10, 1963 I mentioned that 
the hitch-hiker had asked me if I knew a JACK RUBENSTEIN and 
that he had also said that JACK RUBENSTEIN was more commonly 
known as JACK RUBY and that RUBY ran the Carousel Club. 
I 
now wish 
to state that the hitch-hiker in my last statement 
who 
I identified as LEE HARVEY OSWALD did not mention the name 
of RUBY or RUBENSTEIN, 
but apparently had mentioned the name 
of JACK and it was for that reason that 
I asked him if he was 
referring to the man that owns Jack Branch Office Lounge. 
I 
wish to state now that 
I cannot positively state that he used 
the name RUBY or RUBENSTEIN, 
Also in my statement of December 10, 1963 I said that 
the hitch-hiker had asked me if I thought the President could 
— 
be killed with a gun like the one 
I mentioned in that statement. 
This is not entirely accurate, 
The hitch-hiker rather asked 
me if 
I thought 
a man could be shot from up on top of a building 
or out of a window, 
CD 329 dec | 

--- PAGE 21 ---

DBL 100~10461 
"In my statement of December 10, 1963 I mentioned: 
‘After 
I got back from Irving, 
that same day, 
I told DEMPSEY 
JONES, 
a man that 
I work with, about the conversation 
I had 
ae 
with this man.' 
I wish to explain that my conversation with 
DEMPSEY was as follows: 
I mentioned to DEMPSEY that a co-incidence 
had happened that morning, explaining that I had picked up a 
hitch-hiker who said the same thing that DEMPSEY and 
I had 
talked about previously, namely, that a man could be shot 
from a window or from a building top when a man would be coming 
— 
up from under the Continental Underpass. 
This is all 
I can 
3 
remember about my conversation with DEMPSEY. 
Outside of the above changes my statement of December 10, 
1963 is accurate, 
I have read this statement and it is true an_ correct,

During the night of January 8, 
1964, RALPH LEON 
YATES telephoned SA C. RAY HALL, 
ahd stated he desired to 
talk with SA BALL again. 
During the telephone call, YATES 
was crying, 
and sounded 
as 
if he were emotionally upset. 
On January 
9, 
1964, YATES appeared 
at the Dallas 
Office, and stated he had been extremely upset and nervous 
about the report he had made to the FBI, that he had picked 
up a hitch-hiker that he believed to be LEE HARVEY OSWALD. 
He said he had become very suspicious of the people he 
worked with. 
Everything he previously reported seemed 
unreal to him, 
as 
if he had dreamed it,’ but he is positive 
that everything had actually happened just 
as he had reported. 
He said that his father had 
a nervous breakdown when he, 
RALPH LEON, YATES , 
was 
a young boy, but 
so far 
as he knows his 
father was never treated by 
a doctor or at any institution 
for this nervots breakdown. 
Ais uncle, CHARLES YATES, has 
been confined at the Terrell State Hospital, Terrell, Texas, 
for rental treatment, 
and 
is presently on leave from that 
hospital. 
His* grandfather, JAMES YATES, was treated at'a 
mental hospital at Alton, or Woodriver, Illinois, about 
twenty-five or’ thirty years ago. 
q 
RALPH LEON YATES stated, however, that he 
is sure 
he is all right. 
‘He said that it bothers him a'great deal, 
because at one time he lived on Garfield Street, 
in 
Edwardsville, Illinois, and President GARFIELD was assassinated. 
BARNEY T. WYATT, who is 
a great uncle, 
or some kind of distant 
relative of YATES', 
is 
a printer, 
and WYATT has done gome 
printing work for JACK RUBY. 
YATES said that things like this 
just seem to involve him, somehow, 
in something and he 
can't figure out what it is.

Mrs. RALPH LEON YATES, 13564 Brookgreen, Dallas, 
Texas, advised that her husband has discussed with her the 
report he had made 
to the FBI about picking up 
a hitchhiker 
he thought was LEE HARVEY OSWALD. 
Mrs. YATES stated her husband is 
a very truthful 
person, 
and she ordinarily has no reason to doubt anything 
he tells. 
She does know he mentioned nothing about this to 
her, until after everything he told that indicated he had 
picked up LEE HARVEY OSWALD had appeared in the newspapers 
and on television. 
Her husband has been so upset and nervous 
since the assassination of President KENNEDY that she is now 
concerned about his mental condition. 
She explained that her 
husband was abandoned by his mother when he was less than two 
years old. 
When he was about ten years old, his father and 
stepmother moved away and left him to try to find a place 
to live with relatives, 
so he has felt rather insecure all 
his life. 
Her husband's paternal grandfather, name not know, 
was in a mental institution in Illinois for some time; his 
paternal uncle, CHARLEY YATES, has spent over a year at Terrell 
State Hospital, Terrell, Texas, and still thinks he is Jesus 
Christ, 
and 
his paternal aunt, Mrs. GLADYS SMITH, has spent 
a lot of time at Timberlawn Sanitarium in Dallas, Texas, for 
treatment of her mental condition. 
Mrs. SMITH frequently imagines that things have 
happened to her, 
that never happened, and Mrs. YATES is now 
aeeeeal that her husband is having the same type of diffi- 
culty. 
1 
ad 
Her husband has told her nothing which would in- 
dicate that he is deli weretely lying about picking up LEE 
HARVEY OSWALD as 
a hitchhiker, and she thinks her husband 
now really believes he did talk with OSWALD, 
but she is not 
sure that this happened at all, 
and thinks it entirely possi- 
ble her husband is suffering from a hereditary mental condition. 
So far as she knows, her husband has not been examined by any 
doctor, or treated by any doctor, 
for any mental condition.

13564 Brookgreen, Dallas, Texas, appeared at the Dallas Office 
of the FBI, 
Mr. YATES had a small ladies overnight case with 
| 
him, and inside 
he had several bottles of pills and capsules 
which he stated he would like to have analyzed, because he 
thought his doctors were trying to kill him. 
YATES said he 
was afraid he was losing his mind. 
These bottles of medicine 
had been prescribed for him by several doctors over an extended 
period of time. 
It was suggested to YATES that he contact his 
own doctor, 
or seek help at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas, 
the City-County Hospital. 
YATES stated he had tried to put 
| 
down on paper, 
all his thoughts about his contact with 
LEE HARVEY OSWALD, 
and the death of President KENNEDY, 
and 
he furnished the following written account: 
"Amegan Boy.

allegation that individual named STACY may have had something 
to do with telescopic aight 
on assassination weapon, negative. 
FBI Laboratory examination of two books 
in Russian entitled 
"Book of Useful Advice" and "Our Children" did not reveal 
any indications they were used 
for code or cipher purposes. 
Examination of blue jacket (previously identified by 
MARINA OSWALD as belonging to subject) reveals several 
brown head hairs and head hair clippings 
in the debris 
removed from such jacket. 
Such hairs match in microscopic 
characteristics the previous submitted hair samples 
of 
OSWALD. 
None of the textile fibers previously removed from 
assassination weapon could be associated with this jacket. 
No gunpowder residuds present on-this jacket. 
Additional 
investigation conducted concerning OSWALD's alleged effort 
to purchase car at Dallas, Texas on 11/9/63. 
RUTH PAINE 
states OSWALD was at her residence on afternoon of 11/9/63 
and 
in her opinion 
it would have been impossible for 
OSWALD 
to have been at Downtown Lincoln-Mercury, Dallas,
