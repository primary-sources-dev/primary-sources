# About Primary Sources: The Historical Engine

## The Vision: History is a Data Problem
The **Primary Sources Platform** is built on a single, powerful premise: *History is not a book; it is a network.* 

While traditional archives give you folders of papers, Primary Sources gives you an **Atomic Chronological Engine**. We decompose history into its smallest possible units—individual assertions made by specific people at specific moments—to build a high-fidelity reconstruction of the past.

## The "Atomic" Philosophy
The platform is designed to be **Subject-Agnostic**. This means the underlying architecture doesn't care if it's tracking a 1963 motorcade, a 1920s baseball season, or your own great-grandfather’s migration to America. 

By utilizing a **4NF (Fourth Normal Form) Relational Schema**, we map the "Five Pillars of Truth":
1.  **Events**: The "When" (Strict chronological sequencing).
2.  **People**: The "Who" (Actors and their evolving roles).
3.  **Places**: The "Where" (Spatial coordinates and regional context).
4.  **Objects**: The "What" (Physical artifacts, exhibits, and evidence).
5.  **Assertions**: The "Why" (The layer of claims, testimony, and conflicting reports).

## Versatility: One Engine, Infinite Worlds
Because the engine is atomic rather than narrative, it can be repurposed for any domain that requires forensic chronological accuracy:

### 🔎 Forensic Investigations
Track cold cases or historical crimes by mapping contradictory witness statements on a **Conflict Heatmap**. Reveal where the evidence "screams" and where it stays silent.

### ⚾ Sports Reconstruction
Rebuild lost sports eras. By entering box scores as "Events" and player stats as "Assertions," the engine can simulate an entire 1920s season as if it were happening live today.

### 🎭 Cultural & Social History
Map the spread of a musical genre or the impact of a commodity price change across a city. Use the **Inflation Converter** to see the 1963 economy in 2026 dollars.

### 🌳 Genealogy & Family Lineage
Connect your own family records to the global timeline. The **Lineage Engine** helps you discover if your ancestors crossed paths with major historical events by overlaying private family "Assertions" onto the public historical record.
